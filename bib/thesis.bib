Radar satellite remote sensing has the potential to provide this information but current approaches are not suitable for mapping African malarial mosquito aquatic habitats that tend to be highly dynamic, often with emergent vegetation. We present a novel approach for mapping both open and vegetated water bodies using serial Sentinel-1 imagery for Western Zambia. This region is dominated by the seasonally inundated Upper Zambezi floodplain that suffers from a number of public health challenges. The approach uses open source segmentation and machine learning (extra trees classifier), applied to training data that are automatically derived using freely available ancillary data. Refinement is implemented through a consensus approach and Otsu thresholding to eliminate false positives due to dry flat sandy areas. The results indicate a high degree of accuracy (mean overall accuracy 92\% st dev 3.6) providing a tractable solution for operationally mapping water bodies in similar large river floodplain unforested environments. For the period studied, 70\% of the total water extent mapped was attributed to vegetated water, highlighting the importance of mapping both open and vegetated water bodies for surface water mapping.},

At an early stage, exploratory models are valuable in exploring the characteristics of an ideal biological control agent and for guidance in data collection. When more data are available, models can be used to explore alternative control strategies and the likelihood of success. There are few modeling studies that explicitly consider biological control in mosquitoes; however, there have been many theoretical studies of biological control in other insect systems and of mosquitoes and mosquito-borne diseases in general. Examples are used here to illustrate important aspects of designing, using and interpreting models. The stability properties of a model are valuable in assessing the potential of a biological control agent, but may not be relevant to a mosquito population with frequent environmental perturbations. The time scale and goal of proposed control strategies are important considerations when analyzing a model. The underlying biology of the mosquito host and the biological control agent must be carefully considered when deciding what to include in a model. Factors such as density dependent population growth in the host, the searching efficiency and aggregation of a natural enemy, and the resource base of both have been shown to influence the stability and dynamics of the interaction. Including existing mosquito control practices into a model is useful if biological control is proposed for locations with current insecticidal control. The development of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies can be enhanced using modeling techniques, as a wide variety of options can be simulated and examined. Models can also be valuable in comparing alternate routes of disease transmission and to investigate the level of control needed to reduce transmission.},

	abstract = {This chapter reviews aspects of population dynamics that may be conceptually important for biological control of mosquitoes. Density dependent population regulation among immature stages has important implications for biological control of mosquito populations, primarily because it can lead to compensatory or overcompensatory mortality due to additions of a biological control agent. This can result in control efforts leading to no change in the target population, or actual increases in the target population, respectively. Density dependent effects, and compensatory or overcompensatory mortality, appear to be most common in mosquitoes from container or highly ephemeral habitats. In permanent ground water habitats generalist predators appear to limit mosquito populations and so render mortality additive. Thus, biological control in permanent ground water habitats seems to have the highest likelihood of producing a satisfactory result. A central premise of classical biological control is that pest populations are reduced by enemies to stable equilibrium levels that are both below the pre-control equilibrium level, and well below the level producing detrimental effects. This premise results in predictions that successful biological control is likely to involve specialist enemies (usually parasitoids), with short generation times relative to the victim, high rates of successful search, rapid rates of increase, and needing only a few victims to complete their life cycle. These predictions largely fail for mosquito systems, in which successful biological control seems to be associated with generalist enemies that can kill a large portion of the target population, often causing local extinction, and can persist in the absence of the target organism. Biological control of mosquitoes appears to be inherently unstable, thus contrasting sharply with classical biological control. This review suggests a need for better data on density dependent regulation of mosquito populations.},

However, these data products, which are of very different characteristics and based on different modeling assumptions, have never been systematically reviewed and compared, which may impede their appropriate use. This article fills this gap and presents, compares and discusses a set of large-scale (global and continental) gridded datasets representing population counts or densities.

	abstract = {Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) interventions can reduce malaria transmission by targeting mosquitoes when they feed upon sleeping humans and/or rest inside houses, livestock shelters or other man-made structures. However, many malaria vector species can maintain robust transmission, despite high coverage of LLINs/IRS containing insecticides to which they are physiologically fully susceptible, because they exhibit one or more behaviours that define the biological limits of achievable impact with these interventions: (1) Natural or insecticide-induced avoidance of contact with treated surfaces within houses and early exit from them, thus minimizing exposure hazard of vectors which feed indoors upon humans; (2) Feeding upon humans when they are active and unprotected outdoors, thereby attenuating personal protection and any consequent community-wide suppression of transmission; (3) Feeding upon animals, thus minimizing contact with insecticides targeted at humans or houses; (4) Resting outdoors, away from insecticide-treated surfaces of nets, walls and roofs. Residual malaria transmission is, therefore, defined as all forms of transmission that can persist after achieving full universal coverage with effective LLINs and/or IRS containing active ingredients to which local vector populations are fully susceptible. Residual transmission is sufficiently intense across most of the tropics to render malaria elimination infeasible without new or improved vector control methods. Many novel or improved vector control strategies to address residual transmission are emerging that either: (1) Enhance control of adult vectors that enter houses to feed and/or rest by killing, repelling or excluding them; (2) Kill or repel adult mosquitoes when they attack people outdoors; (3) Kill adult mosquitoes when they attack livestock; (4) Kill adult mosquitoes when they feed upon sugar or; (5) Kill immature mosquitoes in aquatic habitats. To date, none of these options has sufficient supporting evidence to justify full-scale programmatic implementation. Concerted investment in their rigorous selection, development and evaluation is required over the coming decade to enable control and, ultimately, elimination of residual malaria transmission. In the meantime, national programmes may assess options for addressing residual transmission under programmatic conditions through pilot studies with strong monitoring, evaluation and operational research components, similar to the Onchocerciasis Control Programme.},

	abstract = {Geographic Object-based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) is increasingly used to process high-spatial resolution imagery, with applications ranging from single species detection to habitat and land cover mapping. Image segmentation plays a key role in GEOBIA workflows, allowing to partition images into homogenous and mutually exclusive regions. Nonetheless, segmentation techniques require a robust parameterization to achieve the best results. Frequently, inappropriate parameterization leads to sub-optimal results and difficulties in comparing distinct methods. Here, we present an approach based on Genetic Algorithms (GA) to optimize image segmentation parameters by using the performance scores from object-based classification, thus allowing to assess the adequacy of a segmented image in relation to the classification problem. This approach was implemented in a new R package called SegOptim, in which several segmentation algorithms are interfaced, mostly from open-source software (GRASS GIS, Orfeo Toolbox, RSGISLib, SAGA GIS, TerraLib), but also from proprietary software (ESRI ArcGIS). SegOptim also provides access to several machine-learning classification algorithms currently available in R, including Gradient Boosted Modelling, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest. We tested our approach using very-high to high spatial resolution images collected from an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (0.03 – 0.10 m), WorldView-2 (2 m), RapidEye (5 m) and Sentinel-2 (10 – 20 m) in six different test sites located in northern Portugal with varying environmental conditions and for different purposes, including invasive species detection and land cover mapping. The results highlight the added value of our novel comparison of image segmentation and classification algorithms. Overall classification performances (assessed through cross-validation with the Kappa index) ranged from 0.85 to 1.00. Pilot-tests show that our GA-based approach is capable of providing sound results for optimizing the parameters of different segmentation algorithms, with benefits for classification accuracy and for comparison across techniques. We also verified that no particular combination of an image segmentation and a classification algorithm is suited for all the tasks/objectives. Consequently, it is crucial to compare and optimize available methods to understand which one is more suited for a certain objective. Our approach allows a closer integration between the segmentation and classification stages, which is of high importance for GEOBIA workflows. The results from our tests confirm that this integration has benefits for comparing and optimizing both processes. We discuss some limitations of the SegOptim approach (and potential solutions) as well as a future roadmap to expand its current functionalities.},

	abstract = {The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for remote sensing applications is becoming more frequent. However, this type of information can result in several software problems related to the huge amount of data available. Object-based image analysis (OBIA) has proven to be superior to pixel-based analysis for very high-resolution images. The main objective of this work was to explore the potentialities of the OBIA methods available in two different open source software applications, Spring and OTB/Monteverdi, in order to generate an urban land cover map. An orthomosaic derived from UAVs was considered, 10 different regions of interest were selected, and two different approaches were followed. The first one (Spring) uses the region growing segmentation algorithm followed by the Bhattacharya classifier. The second approach (OTB/Monteverdi) uses the mean shift segmentation algorithm followed by the support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Two strategies were followed: four classes were considered using Spring and thereafter seven classes were considered for OTB/Monteverdi. The SVM classifier produces slightly better results and presents a shorter processing time. However, the poor spectral resolution of the data (only RGB bands) is an important factor that limits the performance of the classifiers applied.},

These advances, and the availability of sub-meter resolution data from commercial satellites, contribute to seamless mapping and modelling of diseases, not only at continental scales (1 km2) and local community or agricultural field scales (15–30 m2), but for the first time, also at the habitat–household scale ({\textless}1 m2).

Malaria transmission is a multi-scale process strongly controlled by environmental factors, and the use of remote-sensing data is suitable for the characterization of its spatial and temporal dynamics. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is well-adapted to tropical areas, since it is capable of imaging independent of light and weather conditions. In this study, we highlight the contribution of SAR sensors in the assessment of the relationship between vectors, malaria and the environment in the Amazon region. More specifically, we focus on the SAR-based characterization of potential breeding sites of mosquito larvae, such as man-made water collections and natural wetlands, providing guidelines for the use of SAR capabilities and techniques in order to optimize vector control and malaria surveillance. In light of these guidelines, we propose a framework for the production of spatialized indicators and malaria risk maps based on the combination of SAR, entomological and epidemiological data to support malaria risk prevention and control actions in the field.},

	abstract = {There is a long history of considering the constituent components of malaria risk and the malaria transmission cycle via the use of mathematical models, yet strategic planning in endemic countries tends not to take full advantage of available disease intelligence to tailor interventions. National malaria programmes typically make operational decisions about where to implement vector control and surveillance activities based upon simple categorizations of annual parasite incidence. With technological advances, an enormous opportunity exists to better target specific malaria interventions to the places where they will have greatest impact by mapping and evaluating metrics related to a variety of risk components, each of which describes a different facet of the transmission cycle. Here, these components and their implications for operational decision-making are reviewed. For each component, related mappable malaria metrics are also described which may be measured and evaluated by malaria programmes seeking to better understand the determinants of malaria risk. Implementing tailored programmes based on knowledge of the heterogeneous distribution of the drivers of malaria transmission rather than only consideration of traditional metrics such as case incidence has the potential to result in substantial improvements in decision-making. As programmes improve their ability to prioritize their available tools to the places where evidence suggests they will be most effective, elimination aspirations may become increasingly feasible.},

	abstract = {The increasing need for high quality Habitat/Land-Cover (H/LC) maps has triggered considerable research into novel machine-learning based classification models. In many cases, H/LC classes follow pre‐defined hierarchical classification schemes (e.g., CORINE), in which fine H/LC categories are thematically nested within more general categories. However, none of the existing machine-learning algorithms account for this pre-defined hierarchical structure. Here we introduce a novel Random Forest (RF) based application of hierarchical classification, which fits a separate local classification model in every branching point of the thematic tree, and then integrates all the different local models to a single global prediction. We applied the hierarchal RF approach in a NATURA 2000 site in Italy, using two land-cover (CORINE, FAO-LCCS) and one habitat classification scheme (EUNIS) that differ from one another in the shape of the class hierarchy. For all 3 classification schemes, both the hierarchical model and a flat model alternative provided accurate predictions, with kappa values mostly above 0.9 (despite using only 2.2–3.2\% of the study area as training cells). The flat approach slightly outperformed the hierarchical models when the hierarchy was relatively simple, while the hierarchical model worked better under more complex thematic hierarchies. Most misclassifications came from habitat pairs that are thematically distant yet spectrally similar. In 2 out of 3 classification schemes, the additional constraints of the hierarchical model resulted with fewer such serious misclassifications relative to the flat model. The hierarchical model also provided valuable information on variable importance which can shed light into “black-box” based machine learning algorithms like RF. We suggest various ways by which hierarchical classification models can increase the accuracy and interpretability of H/LC classification maps.},

	abstract = {Monitoring open water bodies accurately is an important and basic application in remote sensing. Various water body mapping approaches have been developed to extract water bodies from multispectral images. The method based on the spectral water index, especially the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MDNWI) calculated from the green and Shortwave-Infrared (SWIR) bands, is one of the most popular methods. The recently launched Sentinel-2 satellite can provide fine spatial resolution multispectral images. This new dataset is potentially of important significance for regional water bodies’ mapping, due to its free access and frequent revisit capabilities. It is noted that the green and SWIR bands of Sentinel-2 have different spatial resolutions of 10 m and 20 m, respectively. Straightforwardly, MNDWI can be produced from Sentinel-2 at the spatial resolution of 20 m, by upscaling the 10-m green band to 20 m correspondingly. This scheme, however, wastes the detailed information available at the 10-m resolution. In this paper, to take full advantage of the 10-m information provided by Sentinel-2 images, a novel 10-m spatial resolution MNDWI is produced from Sentinel-2 images by downscaling the 20-m resolution SWIR band to 10 m based on pan-sharpening. Four popular pan-sharpening algorithms, including Principle Component Analysis (PCA), Intensity Hue Saturation (IHS), High Pass Filter (HPF) and À Trous Wavelet Transform (ATWT), were applied in this study. The performance of the proposed method was assessed experimentally using a Sentinel-2 image located at the Venice coastland. In the experiment, six water indexes, including 10-m NDWI, 20-m MNDWI and 10-m MNDWI, produced by four pan-sharpening algorithms, were compared. Three levels of results, including the sharpened images, the produced MNDWI images and the finally mapped water bodies, were analysed quantitatively. The results showed that MNDWI can enhance water bodies and suppressbuilt-up features more efficiently than NDWI. Moreover, 10-m MNDWIs produced by all four pan-sharpening algorithms can represent more detailed spatial information of water bodies than 20-m MNDWI produced by the original image. Thus, MNDWIs at the 10-m resolution can extract more accurate water body maps than 10-m NDWI and 20-m MNDWI. In addition, although HPF can produce more accurate sharpened images and MNDWI images than the other three benchmark pan-sharpening algorithms, the ATWT algorithm leads to the best 10-m water bodies mapping results. This is no necessary positive connection between the accuracy of the sharpened MNDWI image and the map-level accuracy of the resultant water body maps.},

	abstract = {Malaria is a serious public health threat in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), and its transmission risk varies geographically. Modelling its geographic characteristics is essential for identifying the spatial and temporal risk of malaria transmission. Remote sensing (RS) has been serving as an important tool in providing and assessing a variety of potential climatic/environmental malaria transmission variables in diverse areas. This review focuses on the utilization of RS-driven climatic/environmental variables in determining malaria transmission in SSA. A systematic search on Google Scholar and the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of KnowledgeSM databases (PubMed, Web of Science and ScienceDirect) was carried out. We identified thirty-five peer-reviewed articles that studied the relationship between remotely-sensed climatic variable(s) and malaria epidemiological data in the SSA sub-regions. The relationship between malaria disease and different climatic/environmental proxies was examined using different statistical methods. Across the SSA sub-region, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from either the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) or Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) satellite sensors was most frequently returned as a statistically-significant variable to model both spatial and temporal malaria transmission. Furthermore, generalized linear models (linear regression, logistic regression and Poisson regression) were the most frequently-employed methods of statistical analysis in determining malaria transmission predictors in East, Southern and West Africa. By contrast, multivariate analysis was used in Central Africa. We stress that the utilization of RS in determining reliable malaria transmission predictors and climatic/environmental monitoring variables would require a tailored approach that will have cognizance of the geographical/climatic setting, the stage of malaria elimination continuum, the characteristics of the RS variables and the analytical approach, which in turn, would support the channeling of intervention resources sustainably.},

	abstract = {Background Recent reports of the National Ministry of Health and Treatment of Iran (NMHT) show that Gilan has a higher annual incidence rate of leptospirosis than other provinces across the country. Despite several efforts of the government and NMHT to eradicate leptospirosis, it remains a public health problem in this province. Modelling and Prediction of this disease may play an important role in reduction of the prevalence. Methods This study aims to model and predict the spatial distribution of leptospirosis utilizing Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR), Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) as capable approaches. Five environmental parameters of precipitation, temperature, humidity, elevation and vegetation are used for modelling and predicting of the disease. Data of 2009 and 2010 are used for training, and 2011 for testing and evaluating the models. Results Results indicate that utilized approaches in this study can model and predict leptospirosis with high significance level. To evaluate the efficiency of the approaches, MSE (GWR = 0.050, SVM = 0.137, GLM = 0.118 and ANN = 0.137), MAE (0.012, 0.063, 0.052 and 0.063), MRE (0.011, 0.018, 0.017 and 0.018) and R-2 (0.85, 0.80, 0.78 and 0.75) are used. Conclusion Results indicate the practical usefulness of approaches for spatial modelling and predicting leptospirosis. The efficiency of models is as follow: GWR {\textgreater} SVM {\textgreater} GLM {\textgreater} ANN. In addition, temperature and humidity are investigated as the most influential parameters. Moreover, the suitable habitat of leptospirosis is mostly within the central rural districts of the province.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12936-019-2991-8},
	abstract = {Background A major health burden in Cameroon is malaria, a disease that is sensitive to climate, environment and socio-economic conditions, but whose precise relationship with these drivers is still uncertain. An improved understanding of the relationship between the disease and its drivers, and the ability to represent these relationships in dynamic disease models, would allow such models to contribute to health mitigation and adaptation planning. This work collects surveys of malaria parasite ratio and entomological inoculation rate and examines their relationship with temperature, rainfall, population density in Cameroon and uses this analysis to evaluate a climate sensitive mathematical model of malaria transmission. Methods Co-located, climate and population data is compared to the results of 103 surveys of parasite ratio (PR) covering 18,011 people in Cameroon. A limited set of campaigns which collected year-long field-surveys of the entomological inoculation rate (EIR) are examined to determine the seasonality of disease transmission, three of the study locations are close to the Sanaga and Mefou rivers while others are not close to any permanent water feature. Climate-driven simulations of the VECTRI malaria model are evaluated with this analysis. Results The analysis of the model results shows the PR peaking at temperatures of approximately 22 degrees C to 26 degrees C, in line with recent work that has suggested a cooler peak temperature relative to the established literature, and at precipitation rates at 7 mm day(-1), somewhat higher than earlier estimates. The malaria model is able to reproduce this broad behaviour, although the peak occurs at slightly higher temperatures than observed, while the PR peaks at a much lower rainfall rate of 2 mm day(-1). Transmission tends to be high in rural and peri-urban relative to urban centres in both model and observations, although the model is oversensitive to population which could be due to the neglect of population movements, and differences in hydrological conditions, housing quality and access to healthcare. The EIR follows the seasonal rainfall with a lag of 1 to 2 months, and is well reproduced by the model, while in three locations near permanent rivers the annual cycle of malaria transmission is out of phase with rainfall and the model fails. Conclusion Malaria prevalence is maximum at temperatures of 24 to 26 degrees C in Cameroon and rainfall rates of approximately 4 to 6 mm day(-1). The broad relationships are reproduced in a malaria model although prevalence is highest at a lower rainfall maximum of 2 mm day(-1). In locations far from water bodies malaria transmission seasonality closely follows that of rainfall with a lag of 1 to 2 months, also reproduced by the model, but in locations close to a seasonal river the seasonality of malaria transmission is reversed due to pooling in the transmission to the dry season, which the model fails to capture.},

	abstract = {Malaria, dengue, Zika and other mosquito-borne diseases continue to pose a major global health burden through much of the world, despite the widespread distribution of insecticide-based tools and antimalarial drugs. The advent of CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing and its demonstrated ability to streamline the development of gene drive systems has reignited interest in the application of this technology to the control of mosquitoes and the diseases they transmit. The versatility of this technology has enabled a wide range of gene drive architectures to be realized, creating a need for their population-level and spatial dynamics to be explored. We present MGDrivE (Mosquito Gene Drive Explorer): a simulation framework designed to investigate the population dynamics of a variety of gene drive architectures and their spread through spatially explicit mosquito populations. A key strength of the MGDrivE framework is its modularity: (a) a genetic inheritance module accommodates the dynamics of gene drive systems displaying user-defined inheritance patterns, (b) a population dynamic module accommodates the life history of a variety of mosquito disease vectors and insect agricultural pests, and (c) a landscape module generates the metapopulation model by which insect populations are connected via migration over space. Example MGDrivE simulations are presented to demonstrate the application of the framework to CRISPR/Cas9-based homing gene drive for: (a) driving a disease-refractory gene into a population (i.e. population replacement), and (b) disrupting a gene required for female fertility (i.e. population suppression), incorporating homing-resistant alleles in both cases. Further documentation and use examples are provided at the project's Github repository. MGDrivE is an open-source r package freely available on CRAN. We intend the package to provide a flexible tool capable of modelling novel inheritance-modifying constructs as they are proposed and become available. The field of gene drive is moving very quickly, and we welcome suggestions for future development.},

	abstract = {Geographic variation in environmental conditions as well as host traits that promote parasite transmission may impact infection rates and community assembly of vector-transmitted parasites. Identifying the ecological, environmental and historical determinants of parasite distributions and diversity is therefore necessary to understand disease outbreaks under changing environments. Here, we identified the predictors and contributions of infection probability and phylogenetic diversity of Leucocytozoon (an avian blood parasite) at site and species levels across the New World. To explore spatial patterns in infection probability and lineage diversity for Leucocytozoon parasites, we surveyed 69 bird communities from Alaska to Patagonia. Using phylogenetic Bayesian hierarchical models and high-resolution satellite remote-sensing data, we determined the relative influence of climate, landscape, geography and host phylogeny on regional parasite community assembly. Infection rates and parasite diversity exhibited considerable variation across regions in the Americas. In opposition to the latitudinal gradient hypothesis, both the diversity and prevalence of Leucocytozoon parasites decreased towards the equator. Host relatedness and traits known to promote vector exposure neither predicted infection probability nor parasite diversity. Instead, the probability of a bird being infected with Leucocytozoon increased with increasing vegetation cover (NDVI) and moisture levels (NDWI), whereas the diversity of parasite lineages decreased with increasing NDVI. Infection rates and parasite diversity also tended to be higher in cooler regions and higher latitudes. Whereas temperature partially constrains Leucocytozoon diversity and infection rates, landscape features, such as vegetation cover and water body availability, play a significant role in modulating the probability of a bird being infected. This suggests that, for Leucocytozoon, the barriers to host shifting and parasite host range expansion are jointly determined by environmental filtering and landscape, but not by host phylogeny. Our results show that integrating host traits, host ancestry, bioclimatic data and microhabitat characteristics that are important for vector reproduction are imperative to understand and predict infection prevalence and diversity of vector-transmitted parasites. Unlike other vector-transmitted diseases, our results show that Leucocytozoon diversity and prevalence will likely decrease with warming temperatures.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To better understand the characteristics of spatial distribution of malaria epidemics in Hainan province and to explore the relationship between malaria epidemics and environmental factors, as well to develop prediction model  on malaria epidemics. METHODS: Data on Malaria and meteorological factors were collected in all 19 counties in Hainan province from May to Oct., 2000, and the proportion of land use types of these counties in this period were extracted from digital map of land use in Hainan province. Land surface temperatures (LST) were  extracted from MODIS images and elevations of these counties were extracted from  DEM of Hainan province. The coefficients of correlation of malaria incidences and these environmental factors were then calculated with SPSS 13.0, and negative binomial regression analysis were done using SAS 9.0. RESULTS: The incidence of malaria showed (1) positive correlations to elevation, proportion of forest land  area and grassland area; (2) negative correlations to the proportion of cultivated area, urban and rural residents and to industrial enterprise area, LST; (3) no correlations to meteorological factors, proportion of water area, and unemployed land area. The prediction model of malaria which came from negative binomial regression analysis was: I (monthly, unit: 1/1,000,000) = exp (-1.672-0.399xLST). CONCLUSION: Spatial distribution of malaria epidemics was associated with some environmental factors, and prediction model of malaria epidemic could be developed with indexes which extracted from satellite remote sensing images.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The objective was to study the seasonal effect on the spatial distribution of the incidence of malaria in children under 10 years old living in the Manhica district, Mozambique. METHODS: The data of the clinical malaria incidence were obtained from a study of two cohorts of children followed from December 1996 to July 1999. The cases were obtained by the active detection method. Hierarchical Bayesian models were used to model the incidence of malaria, including spatial correlation nested to climatic season. The models were compared with the deviance information criterion. The age and gender of the children were  also taken into account. RESULTS: The incidence of malaria is associated with age, period and climate season. The incidence presents a clear spatial pattern, with a higher incidence in the neighbourhoods situated in the north and northeast of the Manhica area. The transmission of malaria is highest during the wet season but the spatial pattern of malaria does not differ from that during the dry season. CONCLUSION: The incidence of malaria in Manhica presents a spatial pattern which is independent of the seasonal climatic conditions. The climate modifies the incidence of malaria in the entire region but does not change the spatial pattern of the incidence of this disease. These findings may be useful for the planning of malaria control activities. These activities can be performed taking account that the neighbourhoods with more incidence of malaria do not change over the annual climate seasons.},

QuickBird 0.61 m data, encompassing the visible bands  and the near-infra-red (NIR) band, were selected to synthesize images of An. arabiensis aquatic habitats. These bands and field sampled data were used to determine ecological parameters associated with riceland larval habitat development. SAS was used to calculate univariate statistics, correlations and Poisson regression models. Global autocorrelation statistics were generated in ArcGISfrom georeferenced Anopheles aquatic habitats in the study sites. The geographic distribution of Anopheles gambiae s.l. aquatic habitats in the study sites exhibited weak positive autocorrelation; similar numbers of log-larval count habitats tend to clustered in space. Individual rice land habitat data were further evaluated in terms of their covariations with spatial autocorrelation, by regressing them on candidate spatial filter eigenvectors. Each eigenvector generated from a geographically weighted matrix, for both study sites, revealed a distinctive spatial pattern. The spatial autocorrelation components suggest the presence of roughly 14-30\% redundant information in the aquatic habitat larval count samples. Synthetic map pattern variables furnish a method of capturing spatial dependency effects in the mean response term in regression analyses of rice land An. arabiensis aquatic habitat data.},

We used published collection records of these species and environmental geospatial data to construct consensus ecological niche models (ENM) of each species' potential geographic distribution. The status of the Indian taxon An. fluviatilis S as a species distinct from An. harrisoni has been  debated in the literature, so we tested for differentiation in ecological niche characteristics. The predicted potential distribution of An. minimus is more southerly than that of An. harrisoni: Southeast Asia is predicted to be more suitable for An. minimus, and China and India are predicted more suitable for An. harrisoni, so An. harrisoni seems to dominate under cooler conditions. The distribution of An. minimus is more continuous than that of An. harrisoni: disjunction in the potential distribution of the latter is suggested between India and Southeast Asia Anopheles fluviatilis S occurrences are predicted within the An. harrisoni ecological potential, so we do not document ecological differentiation that might reject conspecificity.

Malaria control strategies can be more successful if the distribution and abundance of mosquito vectors is predicted. However, how mosquito vectors are distributed in space remain poor understood, and this question is rarely studied using spatial methods. This study aims to provide a better understanding of the distribution and abundance of mosquito vectors. To achieve this objective, spatial and non-spatial methods were employed. The data on the distribution of adult mosquitoes, and mosquito breeding habitats in a study area in western Kenya, and  environmental variables were analyzed. RESULTS: The models developed using spatial methods outperformed the models developed using non-spatial methods. Houses close to locations where mosquito breeding habitats were repeatedly observed had more abundant adult female mosquitoes. Distance to high-order streams was identified as an effective predictor for the distribution of adult mosquitoes. CONCLUSION: The spatial method is more effective in modeling the distribution of adult mosquitoes than the non-spatial method. The results of this study can be used to facilitate decision-making related to mosquito surveillance  and malaria prevention.},

RECENT FINDINGS: There has been a significant increase in funding and global support for mass treatment programmes. Local epidemiology is necessary if these programmes are to target the most affected communities, and new mapping tools and mathematical modeling methodologies are identifying the high degree of spatial heterogeneity and the relevance of polyparasitism in estimating attributable morbidity. Recent meta-analyses have highlighted the limited evidence base for many of the claims for treatment benefit. Programme evaluations are beginning to demonstrate good outcomes, but further work is required to assess public health benefit and sustainability of these campaigns. New drugs have been identified which may be necessary to counteract resistance; vaccine studies show early promise as a potentially sustainable approach in the longer term. Research on the impact of helminths and treatment on other diseases continues, with reassuring evidence that mass treatment does not increase prevalence of allergy, and potential treatment benefit for patients with HIV. The relationship with malaria is of particular concern, and further studies are needed to assess how best to integrate control of these diseases. SUMMARY: There has been a major scale-up of  mass treatment in recent years. In this climate, it is vital that such programmes are appropriately evaluated, and that well designed controlled trials assess the  role of deworming in other groups.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Maps of malaria distribution are vital for optimal allocation of resources for anti-malarial activities. There is a lack of reliable contemporary  malaria maps in endemic countries in sub-Saharan Africa. This problem is particularly acute in low malaria transmission countries such as those located in the horn of Africa. METHODS: Data from a national malaria cluster sample survey in 2005 and routine cluster surveys in 2007 were assembled for Somalia. Rapid diagnostic tests were used to examine the presence of Plasmodium falciparum parasites in finger-prick blood samples obtained from individuals across all age-groups. Bayesian geostatistical models, with environmental and survey covariates, were used to predict continuous maps of malaria prevalence across Somalia and to define the uncertainty associated with the predictions. RESULTS: For analyses the country was divided into north and south. In the north, the month of survey, distance to water, precipitation and temperature had no significant association with P. falciparum prevalence when spatial correlation was taken into account. In contrast, all the covariates, except distance to water, were significantly associated with parasite prevalence in the south. The inclusion of covariates improved model fit for the south but not for the north. Model precision was highest in the south. The majority of the country had a predicted prevalence of {\textless} 5\%; areas with {\textgreater} or = 5\% prevalence were predominantly  in the south. CONCLUSION: The maps showed that malaria transmission in Somalia varied from hypo- to meso-endemic. However, even after including the selected covariates in the model, there still remained a considerable amount of unexplained spatial variation in parasite prevalence, indicating effects of other factors not captured in the study. Nonetheless the maps presented here provide the best contemporary information on malaria prevalence in Somalia.},

Differences in transmission seasonality and transmission intensity between endemic regions have been suggested as important factors in determining the effect of multiple species co-infections. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In order to investigate the impact of multiple-species infections on clinical measures of malaria we carried out a cross-sectional community survey in Malawi, in 2002. We collected clinical and parasitological data from 2918 participants aged {\textgreater}6 months, and applied a questionnaire to measure malaria morbidity. We examined the effect of transmission seasonality and intensity on fever, history of fever, haemoglobin concentration ([Hb]) and parasite density, by comparing three regions: perennial transmission (PT), high intensity seasonal  transmission (HIST) and low intensity seasonal transmission (LIST). These regions were defined using multi-level modelling of PCR prevalence data and spatial and geo-climatic measures. The three Plasmodium species (P. falciparum, P. malariae and P. ovale) were randomly distributed amongst all children but not adults in the LIST and PT regions. Mean parasite density in children was lower in the HIST  compared with the other two regions. Mixed species infections had lower mean parasite density compared with single species infections in the PT region. Fever  rates were similar between transmission regions and were unaffected by mixed species infections. A history of fever was associated with single species infections but only in the HIST region. Reduced mean [Hb] and increased anaemia was associated with perennial transmission compared to seasonal transmission. Children with mixed species infections had higher [Hb] in the HIST region. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the interaction of Plasmodium co-infecting species can have protective effects against some clinical outcomes of malaria but that this is dependent on the seasonality and intensity of malaria transmission.},

A total of 65 georeferenced aquatic habitats in various IDP camps were studied to compare the larval abundance of Cx. quinquefasciatus and An. gambiae s.l. The aquatic habitat dataset were overlaid onto Land Use Land Cover (LULC) maps retrieved from Landsat imagery with 150 m x 150 m grid cells stratified by levels of drainage. The LULC change was estimated over a period of 14 years. Poisson regression analyses and Moran's I statistics were used to model relationships between larval abundance and environmental predictors. Individual larval habitat  data were further evaluated in terms of their covariations with spatial autocorrelation by regressing them on candidate spatial filter eigenvectors. Multispectral QuickBird imagery classification and DEM-based GIS methods were generated to evaluate stream flow direction and accumulation for identification of immature Cx. quinquefasciatus and An. gambiae s.l. and abundance. RESULTS: The main LULC change in urban Gulu IDP camps was non-urban to urban, which included about 71.5 \% of the land cover. The regression models indicate that counts of An. gambiae s.l. larvae were associated with shade while Cx. quinquefasciatus were associated with floating vegetation. Moran's I and the General G statistics for mosquito density by species and instars, identified significant clusters of high  densities of Anopheles; larvae, however, Culex are not consistently clustered. A  stepwise negative binomial regression decomposed the immature An. gambiae s.l. data into empirical orthogonal bases. The data suggest the presence of roughly 11\% to 28 \% redundant information in the larval count samples. The DEM suggest a  positive correlation for Culex (0.24) while for Anopheles there was a negative correlation (-0.23) for a local model distance to stream. CONCLUSION: These data  demonstrate that optical remote sensing; geostatistics and DEMs can be used to identify parameters associated with Culex and Anopheles aquatic habitats.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although malaria disappeared from southern France more than 60 years  ago, suspicions of recent autochthonous transmission in the French Mediterranean  coast support the idea that the area could still be subject to malaria transmission. The main potential vector of malaria in the Camargue area, the largest river delta in southern France, is the mosquito Anopheles hyrcanus (Diptera: Culicidae). In the context of recent climatic and landscape changes, the evaluation of the risk of emergence or re-emergence of such a major disease is of great importance in Europe. When assessing the risk of emergence of vector-borne diseases, it is crucial to be able to characterize the arthropod vector's spatial distribution. Given that remote sensing techniques can describe  some of the environmental parameters which drive this distribution, satellite imagery or aerial photographs could be used for vector mapping. RESULTS: In this  study, we propose a method to map larval and adult populations of An. hyrcanus based on environmental indices derived from high spatial resolution imagery. The  analysis of the link between entomological field data on An. hyrcanus larvae and  environmental indices (biotopes, distance to the nearest main productive breeding sites of this species i.e., rice fields) led to the definition of a larval index, defined as the probability of observing An. hyrcanus larvae in a given site at least once over a year. Independent accuracy assessments showed a good agreement  between observed and predicted values (sensitivity and specificity of the logistic regression model being 0.76 and 0.78, respectively). An adult index was  derived from the larval index by averaging the larval index within a buffer around the trap location. This index was highly correlated with observed adult abundance values (Pearson r = 0.97, p {\textless} 0.05). This allowed us to generate predictive maps of An. hyrcanus larval and adult populations from the landscape indices. CONCLUSION: This work shows that it is possible to use high resolution satellite imagery to map malaria vector spatial distribution. It also confirms the potential of remote sensing to help target risk areas, and constitutes a first essential step in assessing the risk of re-emergence of malaria in southern France.},

We present data on the relative abundance, infection status, and spatial distribution of the primary mosquito vector Culex quinquefasciatus Say (Diptera: Culicidae) across a mixed, residential-agricultural community adjacent to Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park on Hawai'i Island. We modeled the effect of agriculture and forest fragmentation in  determining relative abundance of adult Cx. quinquefasciatus in Volcano Village,  and we implement our statistical model in a geographic information system to generate a probability of mosquito capture prediction surface for the study area. Our model was based on biweekly captures of adult mosquitoes from 20 locations within Volcano Village from October 2001 to April 2003. We used mixed effects logistic regression to model the probability of capturing a mosquito, and we developed a set of 17 competing models a priori to specifically evaluate the effect of agriculture and fragmentation (i.e., residential landscapes) at two spatial scales. In total, 2,126 mosquitoes were captured in CO2-baited traps with an average probability of 0.27 (SE = 0.10) of capturing one or more mosquitoes per trap night. Twelve percent of mosquitoes captured were infected with P. relictum. Our data indicate that agricultural lands and forest fragmentation significantly increase the probability of mosquito capture. The prediction surface identified areas along the Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park boundary that  may have high relative abundance of the vector. Our data document the potential of avian malaria transmission in residential-agricultural landscapes and support  the need for vector management that extends beyond reserve boundaries and considers a reserve's spatial position in a highly heterogeneous landscape.},

	abstract = {A central theoretical goal of epidemiology is the construction of spatial models  of disease prevalence and risk, including maps for the potential spread of infectious disease. We provide three continent-wide maps representing the relative risk of malaria in Africa based on ecological niche models of vector species and risk analysis at a spatial resolution of 1 arc-minute (9 185 275 cells of approximately 4 sq km). Using a maximum entropy method we construct niche models for 10 malaria vector species based on species occurrence records since 1980, 19 climatic variables, altitude, and land cover data (in 14 classes). For seven vectors (Anopheles coustani, A. funestus, A. melas, A. merus, A. moucheti, A. nili, and A. paludis) these are the first published niche models. We predict that Central Africa has poor habitat for both A. arabiensis and A. gambiae, and that A. quadriannulatus and A. arabiensis have restricted habitats in Southern Africa as claimed by field experts in criticism of previous models. The results of the niche models are incorporated into three relative risk models  which assume different ecological interactions between vector species. The "additive" model assumes no interaction; the "minimax" model assumes maximum relative risk due to any vector in a cell; and the "competitive exclusion" model  assumes the relative risk that arises from the most suitable vector for a cell. All models include variable anthrophilicity of vectors and spatial variation in human population density. Relative risk maps are produced from these models. All  models predict that human population density is the critical factor determining malaria risk. Our method of constructing relative risk maps is equally general. We discuss the limits of the relative risk maps reported here, and the additional data that are required for their improvement. The protocol developed here can be  used for any other vector-borne disease.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We examined algorithms for malaria mapping using the impact of reflectance calibration uncertainties on the accuracies of three vegetation indices (VI)'s derived from QuickBird data in three rice agro-village complexes Mwea, Kenya. We also generated inferential statistics from field sampled vegetation covariates for identifying riceland Anopheles arabiensis during the crop season. All aquatic habitats in the study sites were stratified based on levels of rice stages; flooded, land preparation, post-transplanting, tillering,  flowering/maturation and post-harvest/fallow. A set of uncertainty propagation equations were designed to model the propagation of calibration uncertainties using the red channel (band 3: 0.63 to 0.69 microm) and the near infra-red (NIR)  channel (band 4: 0.76 to 0.90 microm) to generate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI). The Atmospheric Resistant Vegetation Index (ARVI) was also evaluated incorporating the QuickBird blue band (Band 1: 0.45 to 0.52 microm) to normalize atmospheric effects. In order to determine local clustering of riceland habitats Gi*(d) statistics were generated from the ground-based and remotely-sensed ecological databases. Additionally, all riceland habitats were visually examined using the spectral reflectance of vegetation land cover for identification of highly productive riceland Anopheles oviposition sites. RESULTS: The resultant VI uncertainties did not vary from surface reflectance or atmospheric conditions. Logistic regression analyses of all field sampled covariates revealed emergent vegetation was negatively associated with mosquito larvae at the three study sites. In addition, floating vegetation (-ve) was significantly associated with immature mosquitoes in Rurumi and Kiuria (-ve); while, turbidity was also important in Kiuria. All spatial models exhibit positive autocorrelation; similar numbers of log-counts tend to cluster in geographic space. The spectral reflectance from riceland habitats, examined using the remote and field stratification, revealed post-transplanting and tillering rice stages were most frequently associated with high larval abundance and distribution. CONCLUSION: NDVI, SAVI and ARVI generated from QuickBird data and field sampled vegetation covariates modeled cannot identify highly productive riceland An. arabiensis aquatic habitats. However, combining spectral reflectance of riceland habitats from QuickBird and field sampled data can develop and implement an Integrated Vector Management (IVM) program based on larval productivity.},

	abstract = {The area under investigation, Lower Saxony (Northwest Germany), is a former malaria region with highest incidences along the coastal zones. Malaria had finally become extinct in the early 1950s. Subsequently, further scientific investigations in that field declined. Nevertheless, the vector in shape of Anopheles mosquitoes has still been present in Lower Saxony. Thus, the question arises, whether a new autochthon transmission could take place if the pathogen is introduced again and could develop in Anopheles mosquitoes. Answering this question was the first aim of the investigation at hand. The second one was to examine the spatial and temporal structure of potential transmissions in respect  to the predicted increase of air temperatures according to the IPCC scenarios. To answer these questions, current information about Anophelinae and their distribution and habitat preferences within Germany were collected by literature  research as well as temperature measurements and Anopheles findings were compiled from the German Weather Survey and the Niedersachsisches Landesamt fur Okologie (NLO), respectively. The results reveal a climate warming between the 30-years period from 1961 to 1990 and the years between 1985 and 2004. Induced by higher monthly mean temperatures, the risk of a malaria tertiana transmission is consequently increasing for Lower Saxony as temperature is the determining variable of the mathematical model. The study could demonstrate that most parts of the country are located within a 2 months lasting transmission zone. Although  Germany is not an endemic malaria zone, the pathogen can enter the country most likely by infected people or imported mosquitoes that transport it in their guts.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although malaria imposes an enormous burden on Malawi, it remains a controllable disease. The key strategies for control are based on early diagnosis and prompt treatment with effective antimalarials. Its success, however, depends  on understanding the factors influencing health care decision making at household level, which has implications for implementing policies aimed at promoting health care practices and utilization. METHODS: An analysis of patterns of treatment-seeking behaviour among care-givers of children of malarial fever in Malawi, based on the 2000 Malawi demographic and health survey, is presented. The choice of treatment provider (home, shop, or formal hospital care, others) was considered as a multi-categorical response, and a multinomial logistic regression model was used to investigate determinants of choosing any particular provider. The model incorporated random effects, at subdistrict level, to measure the influence of geographical location on the choice of any treatment provider. Inference was Bayesian and based on Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. RESULTS  AND CONCLUSION: Spatial variation was found in the choice of a provider and determinants of choice of any provider differed. Important risk factors included  place of residence, access to media, care-giver's age and care factors including  unavailability and inaccessibility of care. A greater effort is needed to improve the quality of malaria home treatment or expand health facility utilization, at all levels of administration if reducing malaria is to be realised in Malawi. Health promotion and education interventions should stress promptness of health facility visits, improved access to appropriate drugs, and accurate dosing for home-based treatments.},

This is despite the potential public health importance of co-infection and synergistic opportunities for control. METHODS: Statistical models are presented that predict the large-scale distribution of hookworm in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), based on the relationship between prevalence of infection among schoolchildren and remotely sensed environmental variables. Using a climate-based spatial model of the transmission potential for Plasmodium falciparum malaria, adjusted for urbanization, the spatial congruence of populations at coincident risk of infection is determined. RESULTS: The model of hookworm indicates that the infection is widespread throughout Africa and that, of the 179.3 million school-aged children who live on the continent, 50.0 (95\% CI: 48.9-51.1) million  (27.9\% of total population) are infected with hookworm and 45.1 (95\% CI: 43.9-46) million are estimated to be at risk of coincident infection. CONCLUSION: Malaria  and hookworm infection are widespread throughout SSA and over a quarter of school-aged children in sub-Saharan Africa appear to be at risk of coincident infection and thus at enhanced risk of clinical disease.

Here spatial regression models were applied, aimed at quantifying spatial variation and risk factors associated with malaria hospitalization and in-hospital mortality. METHODS: Paediatric ward register data from Zomba district, Malawi, between 2002 and 2003 were used, as a case study. Two spatial models were developed. The first was a Poisson model applied to analyse hospitalization and minimum mortality rates, with age and sex as covariates. The second was a logistic model applied to individual level data to analyse case-fatality rate, adjusting for individual covariates. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Rates of malaria hospitalization and in-hospital mortality decreased  with age. Case fatality rate was associated with distance, age, wet season and increased if the patient was referred to the hospital. Furthermore, death rate was high on first day, followed by relatively low rate as length of hospital stay increased. Both outcomes showed substantial spatial heterogeneity, which may be attributed to the varying determinants of malaria risk, health services availability and accessibility, and health seeking behaviour. The increased risk  of mortality of children referred from primary health facilities may imply inadequate care being available at the referring facility, or the referring facility are referring the more severe cases which are expected to have a higher  case fatality rate. Improved prognosis as the length of hospital stay increased suggest that appropriate care when available can save lives. Reducing malaria burden may require integrated strategies encompassing availability of adequate care at primary facilities, introducing home or community case management as well as encouraging early referral, and reinforcing interventions to interrupt malaria transmission.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Current malaria control initiatives aim at reducing malaria burden by half by the year 2010. Effective control requires evidence-based utilisation of resources. Characterizing spatial patterns of risk, through maps, is an important tool to guide control programmes. To this end an analysis was carried out to predict and map malaria risk in Malawi using empirical data with the aim of identifying areas where greatest effort should be focussed. METHODS: Point-referenced prevalence of infection data for children aged 1-10 years were collected from published and grey literature and geo-referenced. The model-based  geostatistical methods were applied to analyze and predict malaria risk in areas  where data were not observed. Topographical and climatic covariates were added in the model for risk assessment and improved prediction. A Bayesian approach was used for model fitting and prediction. RESULTS: Bivariate models showed a significant association of malaria risk with elevation, annual maximum temperature, rainfall and potential evapotranspiration (PET). However in the prediction model, the spatial distribution of malaria risk was associated with elevation, and marginally with maximum temperature and PET. The resulting map broadly agreed with expert opinion about the variation of risk in the country, and further showed marked variation even at local level. High risk areas were in  the low-lying lake shore regions, while low risk was along the highlands in the country. CONCLUSION: The map provided an initial description of the geographic variation of malaria risk in Malawi, and might help in the choice and design of interventions, which is crucial for reducing the burden of malaria in Malawi.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: During the Soviet era, malaria was close to eradication in Tajikistan. Since the early 1990s, the disease has been on the rise and has become endemic in large areas of southern and western Tajikistan. The standard national treatment for Plasmodium vivax is based on primaquine. This entails the  risk of severe haemolysis for patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Seasonal and geographical distribution patterns as well as G6PD deficiency frequency were analysed with a view to improve understanding of the current malaria situation in Tajikistan. METHODS: Spatial and seasonal distribution was analysed, applying a risk model that included key environmental  factors such as temperature and the availability of mosquito breeding sites. The  frequency of G6PD deficiency was studied at the health service level, including a cross-sectional sample of 382 adult men. RESULTS: Analysis revealed high rates of malaria transmission in most districts of the southern province of Khatlon, as well as in some zones in the northern province of Sughd. Three categories of risk areas were identified: (i) zones at relatively high malaria risk with high current incidence rates, where malaria control and prevention measures should be  taken at all stages of the transmission cycle; (ii) zones at relatively high malaria risk with low current incidence rates, where malaria prevention measures  are recommended; and (iii) zones at intermediate or low malaria risk with low current incidence rates where no particular measures appear necessary. The average prevalence of G6PD deficiency was 2.1\% with apparent differences between  ethnic groups and geographical regions. CONCLUSION: The study clearly indicates that malaria is a serious health issue in specific regions of Tajikistan. Transmission is mainly determined by temperature. Consequently, locations at lower altitude are more malaria-prone. G6PD deficiency frequency is too moderate  to require fundamental changes in standard national treatment of cases of P. vivax.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Insecticide-treated bed nets (ITN) provide real hope for the reduction of the malaria burden across Africa. Understanding factors that determine access to ITN is crucial to debates surrounding the optimal delivery systems. The influence of homestead wealth on use of nets purchased from the retail sector is well documented, however, the competing influence of mother's education and physical access to net providers is less well understood. METHODS:  Between December 2004 and January 2005, a random sample of 72 rural communities was selected across four Kenyan districts. Demographic, assets, education and net use data were collected at homestead, mother and child (aged {\textless} 5 years) levels. An assets-based wealth index was developed using principal components analysis, travel time to net sources was modelled using geographic information systems, and factors influencing the use of retail sector nets explored using a multivariable  logistic regression model. RESULTS: Homestead heads and guardians of 3,755 children {\textless} 5 years of age were interviewed. Approximately 15\% (562) of children slept under a net the night before the interview; 58\% (327) of the nets used were purchased from the retail sector. Homestead wealth (adjusted OR = 10.17, 95\% CI = 5.45-18.98), travel time to nearest market centres (adjusted OR = 0.51, 95\% CI =  0.37-0.72) and mother's education (adjusted OR = 2.92, 95\% CI = 1.93-4.41) were significantly associated with use of retail sector nets by children aged less than 5 years. CONCLUSION: Approaches to promoting access to nets through the retail sector disadvantage poor and remote communities where mothers are less well educated.},

These exercises should be aware of the accuracy of the demographic information used. METHODS: The analysis presented in  this paper tests the accuracy of five large-area, public-domain human population  distribution data maps against high spatial resolution population census data enumerated in Kenya in 1999. We illustrate the epidemiological significance, by assessing the impact of using these different human population surfaces in determining populations at risk of various levels of climate suitability for malaria transmission. We also describe how areal weighting, pycnophylactic interpolation and accessibility potential interpolation techniques can be used to generate novel human population distribution surfaces from local census information and evaluate to what accuracy this can be achieved. RESULTS: We demonstrate which human population distribution surface performed best and which  population interpolation techniques generated the most accurate bespoke distributions. Despite various levels of modelling complexity, the accuracy achieved by the different surfaces was primarily determined by the spatial resolution of the input population data. The simplest technique of areal weighting performed best. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in estimates of populations at risk of malaria in Kenya of over 1 million persons can be generated by the choice of surface, highlighting the importance of these considerations in deriving per capita health metrics in public health. Despite focussing on Kenya the results of these analyses have general application and are discussed in this wider context.},

	abstract = {Although diarrhoea and malaria are among the leading causes of child mortality and morbidity in Sub-Saharan Africa, few detailed studies have examined the patterns and determinants of these ailments in the most affected communities. In  this paper, we investigate the spatial distribution of observed diarrhoea and fever prevalence in Malawi using individual data for 10,185 children from the 2000 Malawi Demographic and Health survey. We highlight inequalities in child health by mapping the residual district spatial effects using a geo-additive probit model that simultaneously controls for spatial dependence in the data and  potential nonlinear effects of covariates. The residual spatial effects were modelled via a Bayesian approach. For both ailments, we were able to identify a distinct district pattern of childhood morbidity. In particular, the results suggest that children living in the capital city are less affected by fever, although this is not true for diarrhoea, where some urban agglomerations are associated with a higher childhood morbidity risk. The spatial patterns emphasize the role of remoteness as well as climatic, environmental, and geographic factors on morbidity. The fixed effects show that for diarrhoea, the risk of child morbidity appears to be lower among infants who are exclusively breastfed than among those who are mixed-fed. However, exclusive breastfeeding was not found to  have a protective effect on fever. An important socio-economic factor for both diarrhoea and fever morbidity was parental education, especially maternal educational attainment. Diarrhoea and fever were both observed to show an interesting association with child's age. We were able to discern the continuous  worsening of the child morbidity up to 8-12 months of age. This deterioration set in right after birth and continues, more or less linearly until 8-12 months, before beginning to decline thereafter. Independent of other factors, a separate  spatial process produces district inequalities in child's health.},

	doi = {10.1186/1475-2875-4-23},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mosquitoes commute between blood-meal hosts and water. Thus, heterogeneity in human biting reflects underlying spatial heterogeneity in the distribution and suitability of larval habitat as well as inherent differences in the attractiveness, suitability and distribution of blood-meal hosts. One of the  possible strategies of malaria control is to identify local vector species and then attack water bodies that contain their larvae. METHODS: Biting and host seeking, not oviposition, have been the focus of most previous studies of mosquitoes and malaria transmission. This study presents a mathematical model that incorporates mosquito oviposition behaviour. RESULTS: The model demonstrates that oviposition is one potential factor explaining heterogeneous biting and vector distribution in a landscape with a heterogeneous distribution of larval habitat. Adult female mosquitoes tend to aggregate around places where they oviposit, thereby increasing the risk of malaria, regardless of the suitability of the habitat for larval development. Thus, a water body may be unsuitable for adult mosquito emergence, but simultaneously, be a source for human malaria. CONCLUSION: Larval density may be a misleading indicator of a habitat's importance for malaria control. Even if mosquitoes could be lured to oviposit in  sprayed larval habitats, this would not necessarily mitigate -- and might aggravate -- the risk of malaria transmission. Forcing mosquitoes to fly away from humans in search of larval habitat may be a more efficient way to reduce the risk of malaria than killing larvae. Thus, draining, fouling, or filling standing water where mosquitoes oviposit can be more effective than applying larvicide.},

Predictions correspond well to previous estimates, but provide detail regarding spatial discontinuities in the distribution of A. gambiae s.s. that are consistent with population genetic studies. Our predictions also identify large areas of Africa where the presence of A. arabiensis is predicted, but few specimens have been obtained, suggesting under-sampling of the species.

Socioeconomic factors measured  directly at the individual level and site-specific malaria prevalence predicted for the Demographic and Health Surveys' locations by a spatial model fitted to the Mapping Malaria Risk in Africa database were examined as possible risk factors. The analysis was carried out by fitting a Bayesian hierarchical geostatistical logistic model to infant mortality risk, by Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. It confirmed that mother's education, birth order and interval, infant's sex, residence, and mother's age at infant's birth had a strong impact on infant mortality risk in Mali. The residual spatial pattern of infant mortality showed a clear relation to well-known foci of malaria transmission, especially the inland delta of the Niger River. No effect of estimated parasite prevalence could be demonstrated. Possible explanations include confounding by unmeasured covariates and sparsity of the source malaria data. Spatial statistical models of malaria prevalence are useful for indicating approximate levels of endemicity over wide areas and, hence, for guiding intervention strategies.

	abstract = {This paper describes a geographic sampling strategy for ecologic studies and describes the relationship between human activities and anopheline larval ecology in urban areas. Kisumu and Malindi, Kenya were mapped using global positioning systems, and a geographic information system was used to overlay a measured grid, which served as a sampling frame. Grid cells were stratified and randomly selected according to levels of planning and drainage. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in April and May 2001 to collect entomologic and human ecologic data. Multivariate regression analysis was used to test the relationship between  the abundance of potential larval habitats, and house density, socioeconomic status, and planning and drainage. In Kisumu, 98 aquatic habitats were identified, 65\% of which were human made and 39\% were positive for anopheline larvae. In Malindi, 91 aquatic habitats were identified, of which, 93\% were human made and 65\% were harboring anopheline larvae. The regression model explains 82\%  of the variance associated with the abundance of potential larval habitats in Kisumu. In Malindi, 59\% of the variance was explained. As the number of households increased, the number of larval habitats increased correspondingly to  a point. Beyond a critical threshold, the density of households appeared to suppress the development of aquatic habitats. The proportion of high-income households and the planning and drainage variables tested insignificant in both locations. The integration of social and biologic sciences will allow local mosquito and malaria control groups an opportunity to assess the risk of encountering potentially infectious mosquitoes in a given area, and concentrate resources accordingly.},

The climate data covering Jiangsu province and its peripheral area were extracted from the FAOCLIM database, the total growing degree days (TGDD) for Plasmodium vivax were calculated, and spatial distribution for TGDD was analyzed by ArcVeiw  3.0a. RESULTS: The predicted malaria distribution map based on TGDD was created,  which showed that the transmission of malaria decreased gradually from west to east, which can be divided into three belts according to the degree of transmission. The 14-year mean morbidity distribution map of malaria in Jiangsu showed that the middle and west parts of Jiangsu is the most serious endemic area. The morbidity in the areas along the Taihu valley, such as Suzhou, Wuxi and Changzhou, as well as Nantong and a few of northern counties are the lowest. The  morbidity of other places is at the middle level. The 14-year mean morbidity distribution map of malaria is correlated with predicted malaria distribution map for TGDD.

The  recently created continental database of malaria survey results (MARA/ARMA 1998)  provides the opportunity for producing empirical models and maps of malaria distribution at a regional and eventually at a continental level. This paper reports on the mapping of malaria distribution for sub-Saharan West Africa based  on these data. The strategy was to undertake a spatial statistical analysis of malaria parasite prevalence in relation to those potential bio-physical environmental factors involved in the distribution of malaria transmission intensity which are readily available at any map location. The resulting model was then used to predict parasite prevalence for the whole of West Africa. We also produced estimates of the proportion of population of each country in the region exposed to various categories of risk to show the impact that malaria is having on individual countries. The data represent a very large sample of children in West Africa. It constitutes a first attempt to produce a malaria risk map of the West African region, based entirely on malariometric data. We anticipate that it will provide useful additional guidance to control programme managers, and that it can be refined once sufficient additional data become available.},

Recent evidence suggests that  risk groups and the clinical spectrum of severe malaria are related to the intensity of P. falciparum transmission. Climate operates to affect the vectorial capacity of P. falciparum transmission and this is particularly important in the  Horn of Africa and parts of East Africa. We have used a fuzzy logic climate suitability model to define areas of Kenya unsuitable for stable transmission. Kenya's unstable transmission areas can be divided into areas where transmission  potential is limited by low rainfall or low temperature and, combined, encompass  over 8 million people. Among areas of stable transmission we have used empirical  data on P. falciparum infection rates among 124 childhood populations in Kenya to develop a climate-based statistical model of transmission intensity. This model correctly identified 75\% (95\% confidence interval CI 70-85) of 3 endemicity classes (low, {\textless} 20\%; high, {\textgreater} or = 70\%; and intermediate parasite prevalences). The model was applied to meteorological and remote sensed data using a geographical information system to provide estimates of endemicity for all of the 1080 populated fourth level administrative regions in Kenya. National census data for 1989 on the childhood populations within each administrative region were projected to provide 1997 estimates. Endemicity-specific estimates of morbidity and mortality were derived from published and unpublished sources and applied to  their corresponding exposed-to-risk childhood populations. This combined transmission, population and disease-risk model suggested that every day in Kenya approximately 72 and 400 children below the age of 5 years either die or develop  clinical malaria warranting in-patient care, respectively. Despite several limitations, such an approach goes beyond 'best guesses' to provide informed estimates of the geographical burden of malaria and its fatal consequences in Kenya.},

Of 85,197 anophelines collected in 1,276 paired indoor and outdoor landing catches, 40.4\% were Anopheles koliensis Owen, 36.7\% An. punctulatus Donitz, 14.3\% An. karwari (James), 4.9\% An. farauti s.l. Laveran, 3.1\%, An, longirostris Brug, and 0.7\% An. bancroftii Giles. Maps of average indoor biting rates were produced using a Bayesian conditional autoregressive model which allowed for heterogeneities in sampling effort over time and space. Differences in spatial distributions among species were observed among and within villages and were related to the distribution of larval habitats and vegetation.  Abundance of An. punctulatus and An. koliensis decreased with distance from the main waterway and probably from a sago swamp forest at 6 villages in North Wosera. Abundance of An. punctulatus was associated negatively with those of An.  farauti s.l., An. longirostris, and An. bancroftii. The latter 3 species also had relatively low ratios of indoor-to-outdoor biting rates, and earlier biting times than An. punctulatus. Human blood indices of at least 0.79 were observed for all  species except An. bancroftii. Abundance of all 6 species was correlated temporally with recent rainfall, but An. koliensis, An. karwari, and An. longirostris showed greater temporal variability than the other species. An punctulatus and An. koliensis tended to occur together in time and space (index of association, I = 0.85). Weaker associations were seen between An. farauti s.l. and An. longirostris (I = 0.44) and An. koliensis and An. karwari (I = 0.34). The most frequently collected species occurred together and were concentrated near the Amugu river; the remaining species tended to occur together but in different  parts of the Wosera area. The importance of understanding ecological requirements of the different Anopheles vectors and their association with key household and landscape features are discussed in relation to malaria transmission and control.},

One model was developed using a discriminant analysis approach, while the other was based on regression analysis. The models were developed in 1992 for an area around Tapachula, Chiapas, using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite data and geographic information system functions. Using two remotely sensed landscape elements, the discriminant model was able to successfully distinguish between villages with high and low An. albimanus abundance with an overall accuracy of 90\%. To test the predictive capability of the models, multitemporal TM data were used to generate a landscape map of the Huixtla area, northwest of Tapachula, where the models were used to predict risk for 40 villages. The resulting predictions were not disclosed until  the end of the test. Independently, An. albimanus abundance data were collected in the 40 randomly selected villages for which the predictions had been made. These data were subsequently used to assess the models' accuracies. The discriminant model accurately predicted 79\% of the high-abundance villages and 50\% of the low-abundance villages, for an overall accuracy of 70\%. The regression model correctly identified seven of the 10 villages with the highest mosquito abundance. This test demonstrated that remote sensing-based models generated for  one area can be used successfully in another, comparable area.},

	abstract = {Mapping the malaria risk at various geographical levels is often undertaken considering climate suitability, infection rate and/or malaria vector distribution, while the ecological factors related to topography and vegetation cover are generally neglected. The present study abides a holistic approach to risk mapping by including topographic, climatic and vegetation components into the framework of malaria risk modelling. This work attempts to delineate the areas of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax malaria transmission risk in India using seven geo-ecological indicators: temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, forest cover, soil, slope, altitude and the normalized difference vegetation index using multi-criteria decision analysis based on geographical information system (GIS). The weight of the risk indicators was assigned by an analytical hierarchical process with the climate suitability (temperature and humidity) data generated using fuzzy logic. Model validation was done through both primary and secondary datasets. The spatio-ecological model was based on GIS to classify the country into five zones characterized by various levels of malaria transmission risk (very high; high; moderate; low; and very low. The study found that about 13\% of the country is under very high malaria risk, which includes the malaria-endemic districts of the states of Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Jharkhand, Tripura, Assam, Meghalaya and Manipur. The study also showed that the transmission risk suitability for P. vivax is higher than that for P. falciparum in the Himalayan region.

	abstract = {Seasonal variation in the proportion of the population using an insecticide-treated net (ITN) is well documented and is widely believed to be dependent on mosquito abundance and heat, driven by rainfall and temperature. However, seasonal variation in ITN use has not been quantified controlling for ITN access. Demographic and Health Survey and Malaria Indicator Survey datasets, their georeferenced data, and public rainfall and climate layers were pooled for 21 countries. Nine rainfall typologies were developed from rainfall patterns in Koppen climate zones. For each typology, the odds of ITN use among individuals with access to an ITN within their households (”ITN use given access”) were estimated for each month of the year, controlling for region, wealth quintile, residence, year, temperature, and malaria parasitemia level. Seasonality of ITN use given access was observed over all nine rainfall typologies and was most pronounced in arid climates and less pronounced where rainfall was relatively constant throughout the year. Peak ITN use occurred 1-3 months after peak rainfall and corresponded with peak malaria incidence and average malaria transmission season. The observed lags between peak rainfall and peak ITN use given access suggest that net use is triggered by mosquito density. In equatorial areas, ITN use is likely to be high year-round, given the presence of mosquitoes and an associated year-round perceived malaria risk. These results can be used to inform behavior change interventions to improve ITN use in specific times of the year and to inform geospatial models of the impact of ITNs on transmission.},

Identification of factors responsible for the prevalence of parasites is of crucial importance to understand the dynamics of parasite distribution in a changing environment. Mountain areas are especially suitable for studies of factors governing parasite distribution and prevalence due to heterogeneity of landscapes, climatic regimes, and other biotic and abiotic conditions. We examined 903 avian blood smears collected in mountains of Transcaucasia for prevalence of Haemoproteus and Plasmodium. We found that the haemoparasites prevalence differed among bird species and localities, highlighting the environmental components affecting disease distribution. The prevalence of both Haemoproteus and Plasmodium was significantly higher in males, adults, and migratory species than in females, juveniles, and resident species. Geographic Information System (GIS) and linear regression analyses revealed that elevation and monthly average precipitation were strongly correlated with proportion of infected birds with Plasmodium, indicating that the prevalence increased with increase of monthly average temperature and elevation. Birds from forested and high grassed areas were also more infected with avian haemosporidia. Our study provides baseline data for modelling of parasites distribution under global climate change scenarios, which is of great importance for monitoring and management of communities and environment for conservation and human health.},

	abstract = {There is an increasing need to provide spatial distribution maps of the clinical  burden of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Africa. Recent evidence suggests that  risk groups and the clinical spectrum of severe malaria are related to the intensity of P. falciparum transmission. Climate operates to affect the vectorial capacity of P. falciparum transmission and this is particularly important in the  Horn of Africa and parts of East Africa. We have used a fuzzy logic climate suitability model to define areas of Kenya unsuitable for stable transmission. Kenya's unstable transmission areas can be divided into areas where transmission  potential is limited by low rainfall or low temperature and, combined, encompass  over 8 million people. Among areas of stable transmission we have used empirical  data on P. falciparum infection rates among 124 childhood populations in Kenya to develop a climate-based statistical model of transmission intensity. This model correctly identified 75\% (95\% confidence interval CI 70-85) of 3 endemicity classes (low, {\textless} 20\%; high, {\textgreater} or = 70\%; and intermediate parasite prevalences). The model was applied to meteorological and remote sensed data using a geographical information system to provide estimates of endemicity for all of the 1080 populated fourth level administrative regions in Kenya. National census data for 1989 on the childhood populations within each administrative region were projected to provide 1997 estimates. Endemicity-specific estimates of morbidity and mortality were derived from published and unpublished sources and applied to  their corresponding exposed-to-risk childhood populations. This combined transmission, population and disease-risk model suggested that every day in Kenya approximately 72 and 400 children below the age of 5 years either die or develop  clinical malaria warranting in-patient care, respectively. Despite several limitations, such an approach goes beyond 'best guesses' to provide informed estimates of the geographical burden of malaria and its fatal consequences in Kenya.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Good maps of malaria risk have long been recognized as an important tool for malaria control. The production of such maps relies on modelling to predict the risk for most of the map, with actual observations of malaria prevalence usually only known at a limited number of specific locations. Estimation is complicated by the fact that there is often local variation of risk that cannot be accounted for by the known covariates and because data points of measured malaria prevalence are not evenly or randomly spread across the area to  be mapped. METHOD: We describe, by way of an example, a simple two-stage procedure for producing maps of predicted risk: we use logistic regression modelling to determine approximate risk on a larger scale and we employ geo-statistical ('kriging') approaches to improve prediction at a local level. Malaria prevalence in children under 10 was modelled using climatic, population and topographic variables as potential predictors. After the regression analysis, spatial dependence of the model residuals was investigated. Kriging on the residuals was used to model local variation in malaria risk over and above that which is predicted by the regression model. RESULTS: The method is illustrated by a map showing the improvement of risk prediction brought about by the second stage. The advantages and shortcomings of this approach are discussed in the context of the need for further development of methodology and software.},

The  recently created continental database of malaria survey results (MARA/ARMA 1998)  provides the opportunity for producing empirical models and maps of malaria distribution at a regional and eventually at a continental level. This paper reports on the mapping of malaria distribution for sub-Saharan West Africa based  on these data. The strategy was to undertake a spatial statistical analysis of malaria parasite prevalence in relation to those potential bio-physical environmental factors involved in the distribution of malaria transmission intensity which are readily available at any map location. The resulting model was then used to predict parasite prevalence for the whole of West Africa. We also produced estimates of the proportion of population of each country in the region exposed to various categories of risk to show the impact that malaria is having on individual countries. The data represent a very large sample of children in West Africa. It constitutes a first attempt to produce a malaria risk map of the West African region, based entirely on malariometric data. We anticipate that it will provide useful additional guidance to control programme managers, and that it can be refined once sufficient additional data become available.},

Historical meteorologic data, as well as topographic, soil, and vegetation data, were used to model surface wetness and identify potential fresh and swamp water breeding habitats in two northern New Jersey watersheds. Surface wetness was positively associated with the subsequent abundance of the dominant floodwater mosquito species, Aedes  vexans, and the swamp water species, Anopheles walkeri. The subsequent abundance  of Culex pipiens, a species that breeds in polluted, eutrophic waters, was negatively correlated with local modeled surface wetness. These associations permit real-time monitoring and forecasting of these floodwater and nonfloodwater species at high spatial and temporal resolution. These predictions will enable public health agencies to institute control measures before the mosquitoes emerge as adults, when their role as transmitters of disease comes into play.},

Temperature and water available for breeding habitats have been shown to be important primary ecological factors that impact the distribution of the malaria vectors and the rate at which the mosquito and parasite develop. However, to this point, studies focusing on the local level have been met with many inconsistent results when assessing malaria risk using both temperature and precipitation. This paper reviewed existing literature to determine if other ecological factors beyond temperature and water are present that may be modifying any associations present between ecological factors and malaria risk. It was found that the ability for water to pool and persist, water quality, elevation, deforestation, and agriculture have all been associated with malaria and may be modifying risk. Using the primary and modifying ecological variables, identifying the interactions between these factors and specific thresholds for increased malaria risk is critical: filling this knowledge gap would enable communities to develop tailored malaria control interventions targeted to their specific circumstances.},

	abstract = {Aim:The idea of combining predictions from different models into an ensemble has gained considerable popularity in species distribution modelling, partly due to free and comprehensive software such as the R package BIOMOD. However, despite proliferation of ensemble models, we lack oversight of how and where they are used for modelling distributions, and how well they perform. Here, we present such an overview. Location:Global. Methods:Since BIOMOD is freely available and widely used by ensemble species distribution modellers, we focused on articles that apply BIOMOD, filtering the initial 852 papers identified in our structured literature search to a relevant final subset of 224 eligible peer-reviewed journal articles. Results:BIOMOD-based ensembles are used across many taxa and locations, with terrestrial plants being the most represented group of species (n = 72) and Europe being the most represented continent (n = 106). These studies often focus on forecasting distributions in the future (n = 109), and commonly use presence-only species data (n = 139) and climatic environmental predictors (n = 219). An average of six models are used in ensembles, and approximately half of ensembles weight contributions of models by their cross-validation performance. However, discussion about choices made in the modelling process and unambiguous information on the performance of ensemble models versus individual models are limited. The use of independent data to validate model performance is particularly uncommon. Main conclusions:We document the breadth of ensemble applications, but could not draw strong quantitative conclusions about the predictive performance of ensemble models, due to lack of unambiguous information reported. Understanding how and where ensembles are best used when modelling species distributions is important for enabling best choices for different applications. To enable this objective to be achieved, we provide recommendations for thorough reporting practices in a BIOMOD-based ensemble workflow.},

	abstract = {Mapping and anticipating risk is a major issue in the fight against malaria, a disease causing an estimated one million deaths each year. Approximately half the world’s population is at risk and it is of prime importance to evaluate the burden of malaria at the spatial as well as the temporal level. The role of the environment with regard to the determinants of transmission and burden of the disease are described followed by a discussion of special issues such as urban malaria, human population mapping and the detection of changes at the temporal scale. Risk maps at appropriate scales can provide valuable information for targeted control and the present review discusses the essentials of principles, methods, advantages and limitations of remote sensing along with a presentation of ecological, meteorological and climatologic data which rule the distribution of malaria. The panel of commonly used analytic methods is examined and the methodological limitations are highlighted. A review of the literature details the increasing interest in the use of remotely sensed data in the study of malaria, by mapping or modeling several malariometric indices such as prevalence, morbidity and mortality, which are discussed with reference to vector breeding, vector density and entomological inoculation rate, estimates of which constitute the foundation for understanding endemicity and epidemics.},

	abstract = {As malaria declines in parts of Africa and elsewhere, and as more countries move towards elimination, it is necessary to robustly evaluate the effect of interventions and control programmes on malaria transmission. To help guide the appropriate design of trials to evaluate transmission-reducing interventions, we review eleven metrics of malaria transmission, discussing their accuracy, precision, collection methods and costs, and presenting an overall critique. We also review the non-linear scaling relationships between five metrics of malaria transmission; the entomological inoculation rate, force of infection, sporozoite rate, parasite rate and the basic reproductive number, R0. Our review highlights that while the entomological inoculation rate is widely considered the gold standard metric of malaria transmission and may be necessary for measuring changes in transmission in highly endemic areas, it has limited precision and accuracy and more standardised methods for its collection are required. In areas of low transmission, parasite rate, sero-conversion rates and molecular metrics including MOI and mFOI may be most appropriate. When assessing a specific intervention, the most relevant effects will be detected by examining the metrics most directly affected by that intervention. Future work should aim to better quantify the precision and accuracy of malaria metrics and to improve methods for their collection.},

These outputs provide significant information for disease control programmes, allowing spatial targeting and tailored interventions. However, several factors (e.g. sampling protocols or temporal disease spread) can influence predictive mapping outputs. This paper proposes a conceptual framework which defines several scenarios and their potential impact on resulting predictive outputs, using simulated data to provide an exemplar. It is vital that researchers recognise these scenarios and their influence on predictive models and their outputs, as a failure to do so may lead to inaccurate interpretation of predictive maps. As long as these considerations are kept in mind, predictive mapping will continue to contribute significantly to epidemiological research and disease control planning.},

	abstract = {The socio-economic and demographic changes that occurred over the past 50 years have dramatically expanded urban areas around the globe, thus bringing urban settlers in closer contact with nature. Ticks have trespassed the limits of forests and grasslands to start inhabiting green spaces within metropolitan areas. Hence, the transmission of pathogens causing tick-borne diseases is an important threat to public health. Using volunteered tick bite reports collected by two Dutch initiatives, here we present a method to model tick bite risk using human exposure and tick hazard predictors. Our method represents a step forward in risk modelling, since we combine a well-known ensemble learning method, Random Forest, with four count data models of the (zero-inflated) Poisson family. This combination allows us to better model the disproportions inherent in the volunteered tick bite reports. Unlike canonical machine learning models, our method can capture the overdispersion or zero-inflation inherent in data, thus yielding tick bite risk predictions that resemble the original signal captured by volunteers. Mapping model predictions enables a visual inspection of the spatial patterns of tick bite risk in the Netherlands. The Veluwe national park and the Utrechtse Heuvelrug forest, which are large forest-urban interfaces with several cities, are areas with high tick bite risk. This is expected, since these are popular places for recreation and tick activity is high in forests. However, our model can also predict high risk in less-intensively visited recreational areas, such as the patchy forests in the northeast of the country, the natural areas along the coastline, or some of the Frisian Islands. Our model could help public health specialists to design mitigation strategies for tick-borne diseases, and to target risky areas with awareness and prevention campaigns.},

	abstract = {Tree ensembles such as Random Forests have achieved impressive empirical success across a wide variety of applications. To understand how these models make predictions, people routinely turn to feature importance measures calculated from tree ensembles. It has long been known that Mean Decrease Impurity (MDI), one of the most widely used measures of feature importance, incorrectly assigns high importance to noisy features, leading to systematic bias in feature selection. In this paper, we address the feature selection bias of MDI from both theoretical and methodological perspectives. Based on the original definition of MDI by Breiman et al. for a single tree, we derive a tight non-asymptotic bound on the expected bias of MDI importance of noisy features, showing that deep trees have higher (expected) feature selection bias than shallow ones. However, it is not clear how to reduce the bias of MDI using its existing analytical expression. We derive a new analytical expression for MDI, and based on this new expression, we are able to propose a debiased MDI feature importance measure using out-of-bag samples, called MDI-oob. For both the simulated data and a genomic ChIP dataset, MDI-oob achieves state-of-the-art performance in feature selection from Random Forests for both deep and shallow trees.},

	abstract = {There are two cultures in the use of statistical modeling to reach conclusions from data. One assumes that the data are generated by a given stochastic data model. The other uses algorithmic models and treats the data mechanism as unknown. The statistical community has been committed to the almost exclusive use of data models. This commitment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current problems. Algorithmic modeling, both in theory and practice, has developed rapidly in fields outside statistics. It can be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets. If our goal as a field is to use data to solve problems, then we need to move away from exclusive dependence on data models and adopt a more diverse set of tools.},

Yet most geodata-driven approaches currently disregard the spatial and temporal aspects of the data they are based on. Here we present and evaluate a hybrid machine learning approach that combines statistical mixed effects theory with the power of random forests. This approach, namely mixed-effects random forests or MERF, is used to model monthly crimes in New York City (USA). Our results show that MERF leads to lower prediction errors and to lower spatial autocorrelation in the residuals than a standard random forest model. This shows that there are approaches to mitigate the non-geocomputational nature of machine learning methods.},

	abstract = {Background Twenty-seven villages were selected in southwest Burkina Faso to implement new vector control strategies in addition to long lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) through a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT). We conducted entomological surveys in the villages during the dry cold season (January 2017), dry hot season (March 2017) and rainy season (June 2017) to describe malaria vectors bionomics, insecticide resistance and transmission prior to this trial. Methods We carried out hourly catches (from 17:00 to 09:00) inside and outside 4 houses in each village using the Human Landing Catch technique. Mosquitoes were identified using morphological taxonomic keys. Specimens belonging to the Anopheles gambiae complex and Anopheles funestus group were identified using molecular techniques as well as detection of Plasmodium falciparum infection and insecticide resistance target-site mutations. Results Eight Anopheles species were detected in the area. Anopheles funestus s.s was the main vector during the dry cold season. It was replaced by Anopheles coluzzii during the dry hot season whereas An. coluzzii and An. gambiae s.s. were the dominant species during the rainy season. Species composition of the Anopheles population varied significantly among seasons. All insecticide resistance mechanisms (kdr-w, kdr-e and ace-1 target site mutations) investigated were found in each members of the An. gambiae complex but at different frequencies. We observed early and late biting phenotypes in the main malaria vector species. Entomological inoculation rates were 2.61, 2.67 and 11.25 infected bites per human per month during dry cold season, dry hot season and rainy season, respectively. Conclusion The entomological indicators of malaria transmission were high despite the universal coverage with LLINs. We detected early and late biting phenotypes in the main malaria vector species as well as physiological insecticide resistance mechanisms. These data will be used to evaluate the impact of complementary tools to LLINs in an upcoming RCT.},

Approximately half the world’s population is at risk and it is of prime importance to evaluate the burden of malaria at the spatial as well as the temporal level. The role of the environment with regard to the determinants of transmission and burden of the disease are described followed by a discussion of special issues such as urban malaria, human population mapping and the detection of changes at the temporal scale. Risk maps at appropriate scales can provide valuable information for targeted control and the present review discusses the essentials of principles, methods, advantages and limitations of remote sensing along with a presentation of ecological, meteorological and climatologic data which rule the distribution of malaria. The panel of commonly used analytic methods is examined and the methodological limitations are highlighted. A review of the literature details the increasing interest in the use of remotely sensed data in the study of malaria, by mapping or modeling several malariometric indices such as prevalence, morbidity and mortality, which are discussed with reference to vector breeding, vector density and entomological inoculation rate, estimates of which constitute the foundation for understanding endemicity and epidemics.},

	abstract = {It has long been recognized that arthropod populations fluctuate with changes in environmental conditions and these changes occur at various spatial and temporal scales. Empirical studies that have explored associations between vector abundance and the environment often considered meterological events as leading indicators with their effects traditionally restricted to single points in time, such as precipitation 12 days prior to trapping. Field experience, however, suggests that the duration of these environmental effects on vectors often extends over a range or interval of time. Such a scenario is not directly interpretable from cross correlation plots routinely employed to visualize and identify time lag associations. Cross correlation maps are introduced as a way to generalize cross correlation plots and to visualize the effects of environmental conditions over intervals of time. This graphical method is flexible and can include different characterizations of environmental effects, as well as interactions among environmental variables. A time series of daily trapped female Ochlerotatus sollicitans mosquitos and leading meterologic conditions were used for demonstration. Associations shown in cross correlation maps were consistent with the arthropod biology and trapping efficacy and were also stronger than those identified at single time points using cross correlation plots. Poisson regression models for vector abundance built using meterological variables with both single and interval based leading time lags were compared. The approach based on the leading meterological events allowed to extend over time intervals reproduced the Oc. sollicitans daily population dynamics better than the traditional approach.},

	abstract = {Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) such as malaria, dengue, and leishmaniasis exert a huge burden of morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly affecting the poorest of the poor. The principal method by which these diseases are controlled is through vector control, which has a long and distinguished history. Vector control, to a greater extent than drugs or vaccines, has been responsible for shrinking the map of many VBDs. Here, we describe the history of vector control programmes worldwide from the late 1800s to date. Pre 1940, vector control relied on a thorough understanding of vector ecology and epidemiology, and implementation of environmental management tailored to the ecology and behaviour of local vector species. This complex understanding was replaced by a simplified dependency on a handful of insecticide-based tools, particularly for malaria control, without an adequate understanding of entomology and epidemiology and without proper monitoring and evaluation. With the rising threat from insecticide-resistant vectors, global environmental change, and the need to incorporate more vector control interventions to eliminate these diseases, we advocate for continued investment in evidence-based vector control. There is a need to return to vector control approaches based on a thorough knowledge of the determinants of pathogen transmission, which utilise a range of insecticide and non–insecticide-based approaches in a locally tailored manner for more effective and sustainable vector control.},

The review has evaluated their study designs, statistical analysis methods, usage of meteorological variables, and results of those studies. The authors found that the limitations of analytical methods exist in most of the articles. Besides climatic variables, few of them have included other factors that can affect the transmission of vector-borne disease (eg, socioeconomic status). In addition, the quantitative relationship between climate and vector-borne diseases is inconsistent. Further research should be conducted among different populations with various climatic/ecological regions by using appropriate statistical models.},

	abstract = {Malaria transmission is known to be strongly impacted by temperature. The current understanding of how temperature affects mosquito and parasite life history traits derives from a limited number of empirical studies. These studies, some dating back to the early part of last century, are often poorly controlled, have limited replication, explore a narrow range of temperatures, and use a mixture of parasite and mosquito species. Here, we use a single pairing of the Asian mosquito vector, An. stephensi and the human malaria parasite, P. falciparum to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the thermal performance curves of a range of mosquito and parasite traits relevant to transmission. We show that biting rate, adult mortality rate, parasite development rate, and vector competence are temperature sensitive. Importantly, we find qualitative and quantitative differences to the assumed temperature-dependent relationships. To explore the overall implications of temperature for transmission, we first use a standard model of relative vectorial capacity. This approach suggests a temperature optimum for transmission of 29°C, with minimum and maximum temperatures of 12°C and 38°C, respectively. However, the robustness of the vectorial capacity approach is challenged by the fact that the empirical data violate several of the model’s simplifying assumptions. Accordingly, we present an alternative model of relative force of infection that better captures the observed biology of the vector–parasite interaction. This model suggests a temperature optimum for transmission of 26°C, with a minimum and maximum of 17°C and 35°C, respectively. The differences between the models lead to potentially divergent predictions for the potential impacts of current and future climate change on malaria transmission. The study provides a framework for more detailed, system-specific studies that are essential to develop an improved understanding on the effects of temperature on malaria transmission., Many of the mosquito and parasite life history traits that combine to influence the transmission intensity of malaria (e.g., adult mosquito longevity, biting rate, the developmental period of the parasite within the mosquito, and the proportion of mosquitoes that become infectious) are strongly temperature sensitive. Yet, in spite of decades of research, the precise relationships between individual traits and temperature remain poorly characterized. As a consequence, the majority of studies exploring the influence of local environmental conditions, or prospective impacts of climate change, draw on a combination of studies that utilize different experimental methods and a range of mosquito and parasite species. Here, we use the Indian malaria mosquito, Anopheles stephensi, and the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, to thoroughly characterize the influence of temperature on key transmission-related traits. The results reveal a number of novel insights and challenge some longstanding assumptions regarding the nature of mosquito and parasite thermal responses. This study provides an experimental blueprint for further system-specific studies necessary to more fully understand the implications of changing temperatures on malaria transmission.},

In total, 43 scientific papers met the inclusion criteria and were considered in this review. Researchers have examined a wide variety of methodologies ranging from statistical to machine learning algorithms. A number of studies used models and EO data that seemed promising and claimed to be easily replicated in different geographic contexts, enabling the realization of systems on regional and national scales. The need has emerged to leverage furthermore new powerful modeling approaches, like artificial intelligence and ensemble modeling and explore new and enhanced EO sensors towards the analysis of big satellite data, in order to develop accurate epidemiological models and contribute to the reduction of the burden of MBDs.},

	abstract = {Despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier should not be trusted.},

The other uses algorithmic models and treats the data mechanism as unknown. The statistical community has been committed to the almost exclusive use of data models. This commitment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current problems. Algorithmic modeling, both in theory and practice, has developed rapidly in fields outside statistics. It can be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets. If our goal as a field is to use data to solve problems, then we need to move away from exclusive dependence on data models and adopt a more diverse set of tools.},

	abstract = {Hotspots constitute the major reservoir for residual malaria transmission, with higher malaria incidence than neighbouring areas, and therefore, have the potential to form the cornerstone for successful intervention strategies. Detection of malaria hotspots is hampered by their heterogenous spatial distribution, and the laborious nature and low sensitivity of the current methods used to assess transmission intensity. We adopt ecological theory underlying foraging in herbivorous insects to vector mosquito host seeking and modelling of fine-scale landscape features at the village level. The overall effect of environmental variables on the density of indoor mosquitoes, sporozoite infected mosquitoes, and malaria incidence, was determined using generalized linear models. Spatial analyses were used to identify hotspots for malaria incidence, as well as malaria vector density and associated sporozoite prevalence. We identify household occupancy and location as the main predictors of vector density, entomological inoculation rate and malaria incidence. We propose that the use of conventional vector control and malaria interventions, integrated with their intensified application targeting predicted hotspots, can be used to reduce malaria incidence in endemic and residual malaria settings.},

Given the importance of larval nutrition in influencing adult life histories and vector competence in Aedes aegypti, we considered how maternal and paternal nutrition influences offspring. Parental generation females and males were reared on either high or low larval food and mated in four sex-by-parental diet crosses. Offspring traits measured included development time, survivorship, female size, susceptibility to infection with dengue virus, viral titer, and viral dissemination. We found evidence for both maternal and paternal effects on life history traits (with female development time contributing most to this effect), but not viral traits. These results were only evident when mothers mated with high larval food fathers and when fathers mated with high larval food mothers. Offspring from dissimilar nutrient condition parents developed more quickly than offspring from other parental crosses. Overall, results suggest that parental effects in Ae. aegypti are conditionally derived from both the maternal and paternal environment.},

Here, we consider effects of parental and offspring larval nutrition on offspring development time, survivorship and infection with dengue virus in Aedes aegypti, the mosquito vector of dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever and Zika. Parents were raised on either high or low larval detritus inputs with subsequent offspring being divided into two groups, one receiving high nutrients and the other low. Low nutrient females from low nutrient parents (LL) developed significantly slower than those from high nutrient parents (HL). Females from all parent by offspring nutrient treatment groups were equally likely to become infected with dengue virus at 24 h, 3 days and 14 days. After 14 days, high nutrient females from low nutrient parents (LH) had 11 times higher viral titres and more disseminated infections than high nutrient females from high nutrient parents (HH). These results suggest that carry-over environmental stress from the parental generation can influence life histories and arbovirus infection in Ae. aegypti females. We found males to be robust to the life-history parameters measured, suggesting sex-specific differences which may relate to their lower nutrient requirements for metamorphosis.},

This study used a molecular barcoding approach to investigate the natural diets of Anopheles gambiae s.l. larvae in western Kenya. Gut contents from third- and fourth-instar larvae from natural habitats were dissected and DNA was extracted. The 18S ribosomal DNA gene was amplified, the resulting clones were screened using a restriction fragment length polymorphism method and nonmosquito clones were sequenced. Homology search and phylogenetic analyses were then conducted using the sequences of non-mosquito clones to identify the putative microorganisms ingested. The phylogenetic analyses clustered ingested microorganisms in four clades, including two clades of green algae (Chlorophyta, Chlorophyceae Class, Chlamydomonadales and Chlorococcales families), one fungal clade, and one unknown eukaryote clade. In parallel, using the same approach, an analysis of the biodiversity present in the larval habitats was carried out. This present study demonstrated the feasibility of the barcoding approach to infer the natural diets of Anopheles gambiae larvae. Our analysis suggests that despite the wide range of microorganisms available in natural habitats, mosquito larvae fed on specific groups of algae. The novel tools developed from this study can be used to improve our understanding of the larval ecology of African malaria vectors and to facilitate the development of new mosquito control tools.},

Adult mosquito survival is strongly temperature and moisture dependent. Few studies have investigated the interacting effects of these variables on adult survival and how this differs among the sexes and with age, despite the importance of such information for population dynamic models. For these reasons, the desiccation tolerance of Anopheles arabiensis Patton and Anopheles funestus Giles males and females of three different ages was assessed under three combinations of temperature and humidity. Females were more desiccation tolerant than males, surviving for longer periods than males under all experimental conditions. In addition, younger adults were more tolerant of desiccation than older groups. Both species showed reduced water loss rate (WLR) as the primary mechanism by which they tolerate desiccation. Although A. arabiensis is often considered to be the more arid-adapted of the two species, it showed lower survival times and higher WLR than A. funestus. The current information could improve population dynamic models of these vectors, given that adult survival information for such models is relatively sparse.},

Gonotrophic cycle duration was measured using field-collected F1 A. gambiae females. Average ambient temperature in the deforested area of Kakamega (elevation 1,430-1,580 m above sea level), western Kenya, was 0.5 degrees C higher than that of the forested area over a 10-mo period. During the dry season, deforested areas showed an increased mean indoor temperature of 1.8 degrees C, and a shortened duration of the mosquitoes' first and second gonotrophic cycles, by 1.7 d (59\%) and 0.9 d (43\%). During the rainy season, the average indoor temperature of houses located in the deforested area was 1.2 degrees C higher than in houses in the forested area. The duration of the first and second gonotrophic cycles was shortened by 1.5 d (17\%) and 1.4 d (27\%), respectively, in the deforested highland site. A shorter mosquito gonotrophic cycle implies increased daily biting frequency and thus increased vectorial capacity. Together with evidence that deforestation reduced A. gambiae larva-to-adult developmental time and increased larval and adult survivorship, this study suggests that deforestation can further enhance malaria transmission potential in the highlands through increased indoor temperature and shortened gonotrophic cycle durations of A. gambiae mosquitoes.},

	abstract = {Background Larval control is of paramount importance in the reduction of malaria vector abundance and subsequent disease transmission reduction. Understanding larval habitat succession and its ecology in different land use managements and cropping systems can give an insight for effective larval source management practices. This study investigated larval habitat succession and ecological parameters which influence larval abundance in malaria epidemic prone areas of western Kenya. Methods and Findings A total of 51 aquatic habitats positive for anopheline larvae were surveyed and visited once a week for a period of 85 weeks in succession. Habitats were selected and identified. Mosquito larval species, physico-chemical parameters, habitat size, grass cover, crop cycle and distance to nearest house were recorded. Polymerase chain reaction revealed that An. gambiae s.l was the most dominant vector species comprised of An.gambiae s.s (77.60\%) and An.arabiensis (18.34\%), the remaining 4.06\% had no amplification by polymerase chain reaction. Physico-chemical parameters and habitat size significantly influenced abundance of An. gambiae s.s (P = 0.024) and An. arabiensis (P = 0.002) larvae. Further, larval species abundance was influenced by crop cycle (P≤0.001), grass cover (P≤0.001), while distance to nearest houses significantly influenced the abundance of mosquito species larvae (r = 0.920;P≤0.001). The number of predator species influenced mosquito larval abundance in different habitat types. Crop weeding significantly influenced with the abundance of An.gambiae s.l (P≤0.001) when preceded with fertilizer application. Significantly higher anopheline larval abundance was recorded in habitats in pasture compared to farmland (P = 0.002). When habitat stability and habitat types were considered, hoof print were the most productive followed by disused goldmines. Conclusion These findings suggest that implementation of effective larval control programme should be targeted with larval habitats succession information when larval habitats are fewer and manageable. Crop cycles and distance from habitats to household should be considered as effective information in planning larval control.},

	abstract = {We conducted experiments to investigate the importance of algal food resources for larval growth and adult emergence of Anopheles gambiae Giles s.s. in simulated larval habitats in Kenya, and in greenhouse and laboratory microcosms in the United States. In the first experiment, we used shading to reduce algal biomass, and because algal production and larval development might be a function of underlying soil nutrients, we crossed sun-shade treatments with soils of two distinct types collected near larval habitats. Shading reduced pupation rates and total adult biomass of An. gambiae by ≈50\%. Soil type had no significant effect on mosquito production, but it did significantly affect concentrations of phosphorus and chlorophyll a in the surface microlayer. In a subsequent experiment conducted in the greenhouse to reduce temperature differences found between the shaded and sunlit treatments, \&lt;1\% of larvae in the shaded treatments reached the pupal stage. There was a marked reduction of chlorophyll a levels as a function of shading and larval density. In a third experiment, larvae receiving material harvested from sunlit surface microlayers performed as well as those receiving liver powder, whereas those receiving surface microlayer from shaded habitats suffered \&gt;90\% mortality and failed to pupate. In a fourth experiment, glucose was added to shaded microcosms to stimulate bacterial activity in the absence of algae. Bacterial growth rates were 2 to 3 times higher, and larval development was enhanced in glucose-amended treatments. However, pupation rates and adult weights in glucose-amended shaded microcosms were still poor compared with those in nonamended sunlit microcosms. Overall, these results demonstrate the importance of algal biomass in the surface microlayers of larval habitats to development and adult production of An. gambiae.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although larviciding may be a valuable tool to supplement long-lasting insecticide nets (LLINs) in West Africa in different ecological settings, its actual impact on malaria burden and transmission has yet to be demonstrated. A randomized controlled trial was therefore undertaken to assess the effectiveness of larviciding using Bacillus thuringiensis israeliensis (Bti) in addition to the use of LLINs. In order to optimally implement such a larviciding intervention, we first aimed to identify and to characterize the breeding habitats of Anopheles spp. in the entire study area located in the vicinity of Korhogo in northern Côte d'Ivoire.
METHODS: We conducted two surveys during the rainy and the dry season, respectively, in the thirty villages around Korhogo involved in the study. In each survey, water bodies located within a 2 km radius around each village were identified and assessed for the presence of mosquito larvae. We morphologically identified the larvae to the genus level and we characterized all of the habitats positive for Anopheles spp. larvae based on a predefined set of criteria.
RESULTS: Overall, 620 and 188 water bodies positive for Anopheles spp. larvae were sampled in the rainy and the dry season, respectively. A broad range of habitat types were identified. Rice paddies accounted for 61\% and 57\% of the habitats encountered in the rainy and the dry season, respectively. In the rainy season, edges of rivers and streams (12\%) were the second most abundant habitats for Anopheles spp. larvae. More than 90\% of the Anopheles spp. breeding habitats were surrounded by green areas. Dams, ponds and drains produced higher numbers of Anopheles spp. larvae per square meter than rice paddies (RR = 1.51; 95\% CI: 1.18-1.94; P = 0.0010). The density of Anopheles spp. larvae was significantly higher in habitats surrounded by low-density housing (RR = 4.81; 95\% CI: 1.84-12.60; P = 0.0014) and green areas (RR = 3.96; 95\% CI: 1.92-8.16; P = 0.0002] than habitats surrounded by high-density housing. Turbid water [RR = 1.42 (95\% CI: 1.15-1.76; P = 0.0012) was associated with higher densities of Anopheles spp. larvae. The likelihood of finding mosquito pupae in Anopheles spp. breeding habitats was higher in the dry season (OR = 5.92; 95\% CI: 2.11-16.63; P = 0.0007) than in the rainy season.
CONCLUSIONS: Rice paddies represented the most frequent habitat type for Anopheles spp. larvae in the Korhogo area during both the rainy and the dry seasons. Anopheles spp. breeding habitats covered a very large and dynamic area in the rainy season whereas they were fewer in number in the dry season. In this context, implementing a larviciding strategy from the end of the rainy season to the dry season is presumably the most cost-effective strategy.},

All pools of standing water along a 700-m transect were sampled twice per week. For each habitat, eight environmental variables were recorded and a sample of anopheline larvae was collected for identification. In total, 1,751 Anopheles gambiae s.l. and 2,784 Anopheles funestus Giles were identified. Identification of An. gambiae s.l. by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) indicated that 240 (14.7\%) were An. gambiae Giles and 858 (52.4\%) were An. arabiensis Patton; PCR failed to identify 539 (32.9\%) specimens. Repeated measures logistic regression analysis indicated that An. gambiae and An. arabiensis larvae were associated with small, temporary habitats with algae and little or no aquatic vegetation. Anopheles funestus larvae were associated with larger, semipermanent bodies of water containing aquatic vegetation and algae. Direct comparison of habitat characteristics associated with either An. gambiae or An. arabiensis revealed that algae were associated more commonly with habitats containing An. gambiae; no other differences were detected. Chi-square analysis indicated that these species were collected from the same habitat more frequently than would be expected by chance alone. Together, these results indicate that An. gambiae and An. arabiensis have similar requirements for the larval environment and that, at least in western Kenya, they do not segregate into separate habitats.},

	abstract = {Background For malaria control in Africa it is crucial to characterise the dispersal of its most efficient vector, Anopheles gambiae, in order to target interventions and assess their impact spatially. Our study is, we believe, the first to present a statistical model of dispersal probability against distance from breeding habitat to human settlements for this important disease vector. Methods/Principal Findings We undertook post-hoc analyses of mosquito catches made in The Gambia to derive statistical dispersal functions for An. gambiae sensu lato collected in 48 villages at varying distances to alluvial larval habitat along the River Gambia. The proportion dispersing declined exponentially with distance, and we estimated that 90\% of movements were within 1.7 km. Although a ‘heavy-tailed’ distribution is considered biologically more plausible due to active dispersal by mosquitoes seeking blood meals, there was no statistical basis for choosing it over a negative exponential distribution. Using a simple random walk model with daily survival and movements previously recorded in Burkina Faso, we were able to reproduce the dispersal probabilities observed in The Gambia. Conclusions/Significance Our results provide an important quantification of the probability of An. gambiae s.l. dispersal in a rural African setting typical of many parts of the continent. However, dispersal will be landscape specific and in order to generalise to other spatial configurations of habitat and hosts it will be necessary to produce tractable models of mosquito movements for operational use. We show that simple random walk models have potential. Consequently, there is a pressing need for new empirical studies of An. gambiae survival and movements in different settings to drive this development.},

	abstract = {Society responds to changes in climate and land use via mitigation measures, including rainwater retention and storage in rewetted and newly constructed wetlands. Humans living close to these wetlands express concerns about future mosquito nuisance situations, and request the necessary distance between human occupation and wetlands to avoid such problems. Wetland managers need to know the distance required, as well as the type of management needed for such buffer or barrier zones. Here we performed an extensive literature survey to collect quantitative information on mosquito flight distance and the relevant environmental conditions. Mosquitoes have an average maximum flight distance of between 50m and 50km, depending on the species. Long-distance or migratory flights are strongly related to species ecological preferences and physiology, are survived by few specimens, and do not relate to nuisance situations. Nuisance-related or non-oriented flights are also species-specific and cover much shorter distances-between 25m and 6km for the 23 species analyzed. Based on these results, we made regression-based estimations of the percentages of the population that cross certain distances. A 90\% reduction in breeding site population density would require minimal distances of 56m for Anopheles saperoi and 8.6km for Anopheles sinensis, and much greater distances for Aedes vexans, Culex quinquefasciatus, and Culiseta morsitans. Little useful information was available regarding the environmental conditions under which non-oriented flights took place. Qualitatively, the review showed that flight capacity was influenced by landscape structure, meteorological conditions (temperature, humidity, and illumination), and species physiology (energy available for flight). Overall, our findings suggest that predictions regarding the construction of barrier zones around breeding sites can be made based on mosquito and host density and human nuisance perception, and that barrier zone usefulness strongly depends on the mosquito species involved. Additional quantitative research is needed to better document the non-oriented dispersal patterns of the mosquitoes that populate rewetted and newly constructed wetlands, and the effects of vegetation types in barrier zones on mosquito densities.},

The presence of insecticide-treated materials inside the mosquito habitat has consequences for the vector's population, reducing density, survival, contact with humans, and feeding frequency. However, the effectiveness of these tools is being challenged by the emergence of insecticide resistance. The evolution of resistance to insecticides in Anopheles threatens to thwart the goal of decreasing malaria transmission, in an arms race between malaria control programmes and the vector populations. Multiple mechanisms of resistance to insecticides have been observed in Anopheles populations, including target site mutation (knockdown resistance), increased metabolic detoxification, and remarkable behavioural adaptation. These disturbing observations all show the capacity of Anopheles to adapt to and circumvent strategies aimed at reducing malaria transmission. Thus, by using nets to protect ourselves, are we providing Anopheles with the entire arsenal needed to hit much harder?},

The database currently covers the period 1919-2014 and is freely accessible online along with a set of open source codes to handle the data, i.e. transform the data formats, load the standardized data into the database, extract data and compute a suite of indicators (e.g. global maps of catch). The database along with the codes represent the "toolbox".In a previous note ([Taconet et al.]), we have described the general method- ological approach used for the collation and formatting of the data, as well as the bene ts of using standardized data formats and code lists for scien- ti c research and sheries management. In this note, we present the codes available in the toolbox, the services that they oer and how users can access them through various applications. We argue that these methods are likely to bring visibility to the tuna RFMOs public domain datasets, as well as to facilitate their use. Overall, we showcase how the variety of available services and applications enables to reach dierent communities of users that might be interested in accessing tuna fisheries data for various uses and purposes.},

	url = {https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6791010/},
	doi = {10.1186/s13071-019-3715-1},
	abstract = {Background
The global spread of mosquito-borne diseases (MBD) has presented increasing challenges to public health. The transmission of MBD is mainly attributable to the biting behaviors of female mosquitoes. However, the ecological pattern of hourly host-seeking behavior in Aedes albopictus and its association with climatic variables are still not well understood, especially for a precise requirement for establishing an effective risk prediction system of MBD transmission.

Methods
Mosquito samples and data on mosquito hourly density and site-specific climatic variables, including temperature, relative humidity, illuminance and wind speed, were collected simultaneously in urban outdoor environments in Guangzhou during 2016–2018. Kernel regression models were used to assess the temporal patterns of hourly host-seeking behavior in mosquito populations, and negative binomial regression models in the Bayesian framework were used to investigate the associations of host-seeking behavior with climatic variables.

Results
Aedes albopictus was abundant, constituting 82\% (5569/6790) of the total collected mosquitoes. Host-seeking behavior in Ae. albopictus varied across time and was significantly influenced by climatic variables. The predicted hourly mosquito densities showed non-linear relationships with temperature and illuminance, whereas density increased with relative humidity but generally decreased with wind speed. The range of temperature estimates for female biting was 16.4–37.1 °C, peaking at 26.5 °C (95\% credible interval: 25.3–28.1). During the favorable periods, biting behavior of female Ae. albopictus was estimated to occur frequently all day long, presenting a bimodal distribution with peaks within 2–3 h around both dawn and dusk (05:00–08:00 h and 16:00–19:00 h). Moreover, a short-term association in hourly density between the females and males was found.

Conclusions
Our field-based modeling study reveals that hourly host-seeking behavior of Ae. albopictus exhibits a complex pattern, with hourly variation constrained significantly by climatic variables. These findings lay a foundation for improving MBD risk assessments as well as practical strategies for vector control. For instances of all-day-long frequent female biting during the favorable periods in Guangzhou, effective integrated mosquito control measures must be taken throughout the day and night.},

Many bioinformatics studies develop and evaluate classifiers that are to be applied to strongly imbalanced datasets in which the number of negatives outweighs the number of positives significantly. While ROC plots are visually appealing and provide an overview of a classifier's performance across a wide range of specificities, one can ask whether ROC plots could be misleading when applied in imbalanced classification scenarios. We show here that the visual interpretability of ROC plots in the context of imbalanced datasets can be deceptive with respect to conclusions about the reliability of classification performance, owing to an intuitive but wrong interpretation of specificity. PRC plots, on the other hand, can provide the viewer with an accurate prediction of future classification performance due to the fact that they evaluate the fraction of true positives among positive predictions. Our findings have potential implications for the interpretation of a large number of studies that use ROC plots on imbalanced datasets.},

	abstract = {What does “balanced” mean for binary classification data? It simply means that the proportion of each class is equal. In binary classification, data is made up of two classes, positive and negative.

What’s imbalanced classification?

Take 1000 samples for example, one class is 500, and the other class is 500 in balanced data. 50\% of data are positive class, and vice versa. The distribution becomes skewed once it’s shifted toward one class, and is then called imbalanced data.

Imbalanced data is common in real life, such as fraud detection, cancer detection and customer conversion. However, it is not often mentioned in machine learning theory courses, based on my learning experiences. Here are some useful notes summarized from my personal learnings on real life data, that I feel worth sharing with everyone.

How far of a shifted distribution is considered imbalanced? There is no definite answer. Luckily there are some empirical rules to follow:
In Google’s online course, it considers 20 - 40\% minority class as mildly imbalanced, 1 - 20\% as moderately imbalanced, and {\textless}1\% as extremely imbalanced. (Usually, minority class indicates positive class.) In the video from h2o about the top 10 pitfalls in machine learning, it suggests to consider remedies for models when the minority class accounts for less than 10\% of the data.

Moreover, Google’s online course suggests to first train the model on the true distribution before jumping into any possible remedies. If the model works and generalizes, then you are good to go! If not, then other strategies should be considered to improve the model.
I cannot agree more when I first read about the these guidelines. Based on my personal experience, the model will only work sometimes when fitted on true distribution - 20\%{\textasciitilde}40\% minority class - without further treatment. It would be great to have a model fitted on true distribution though, as a benchmark for later.

It is important to consider remedies when it doesn’t work on true distribution, since most algorithms in machine learning learn weights from the data. Imbalanced volume of data would affect the learning process of algorithm - learning way more from the majority class. Here are some remedies for imbalanced classification, but it is not our focus today. We’ll cover it in future posts.

Precision-Recall Curve

In this post, we are going to talk about the Precision-Recall (PR) curve, which is similar to the ROC curve (Receiver Operation Characteristics) but with one of the axis changed from FPR to precision. Notably, the Precision-Recall curve can be used as an alternative metric to evaluate the classifier when the data is imbalanced.

In ROC, the curve is composed of the false positive rate (x-axis) \& the true positive rate/recall (y-axis), as shown in figure below. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is a widely-used metric to assess the overall model performance. The value of AUC ranges from 0 to 1, the larger the better. The ROC curve would move toward the upper right corner when the model performance improves. (Find in-depth discussion in previous post)





On the other hand, the PR curve is composed of the recall/true positive rate (x-axis) \& the precision (y-axis), as shown in figure below. The area under the PR ROC curve (PR AUC) provides a different perspective on evaluating the result of binary classifier. Lager PR AUC value indicates better model performance — the PR curve would move towards the upper left corner.

Not all the value between 0 to 1 is achievable for PR AUC. Varying by data, the baseline of PR curve is the horizontal line with y equals the value of the positive rate — P/(P+N) — the smallest value of precision. When the threshold goes to 0 (i.e. the rightmost point in the graph), all samples are classified as positive samples. That is, the number of true positive is equal to the number of positive samples. Thus, the value of the baseline decreases when the data become more imbalanced.

Details: Precision = TP/(TP + FP),  when threshold = 0, TP = P, FP = N, Precision = P/(P+N)





Note: The ROC \& PR ROC figures are plotted using the same dataset, which is binary classes with balanced classes

Why we need PR curve?

When data is imbalanced, the AUC might not reflect the true performance of the classifier. The definition of the False Positive Rate (FPR), is the number of false positives divided by the number of negative samples. FPR is considered better when it’s smaller since it indicates fewer false positives. In imbalanced data, the FPR tends to stay at small values due to the large numbers of negatives (i.e. making the denominator large). Thus, FPR becomes less informative for the model performance in this situation.

Below is a confusion matrix of an imbalanced dataset. As the figure shown, FPR shows a low value, indicating good model performance. However, precision - 0.09 - illustrates that the model is not able to distinguish between two classes well, and tend to predict more negative samples. Thus, PR AUC provides an alternative view for model performance by switching from FPR to precision.





Let’s have a deep dive into more examples. Here are the ROC curve \& PR curve of the output of binary classifier at various levels of separation and positive rates. In the following examples, 5 different levels of separation are chosen— Perfect, Excellent, Great, Good, Random —  and 3 different positive rates are selected — 0.5, 0.1 and 0.01 ranging from the balanced toward extremely imbalanced.  The data with the same level of separation but different positive rates is all sampled from the same distribution but at different sampling rate.

As the figure of ROC curve shown, the model performance across different positive rates are the same — the shape of ROC curve is nearly identical. On the other hand, the PR curves tell a different story — the model performance decreases when the positive rate decreases. When there are more negative samples, it is common to predict more outcome as negative samples, causing the precision to decrease. The baseline of different positive rates is also shown with the level of separation — Random. Notably, when comparing the ROC \& PR curves at the same positive rate, the overall relationship among various levels of separation is similar in both the ROC \& PR curve. Since the baseline shifted based on the positive rate, it is crucial to compare the PR AUC to baseline first rather than look straight into the absolute value of PR AUC. For example, the PR AUC of the Excellent status with 0.01 positive rate is 0.2. The absolute value of the PR AUC doesn’t look like a good outcome. However, it is 20 times better than the baseline 0.01!





Let’s look into another case. There are two example datasets with the same value of AUC (0.8) but different positive rates. As shown in ROC curve, the curves and values of AUC are all the same regardless of the positive rate. Thus, it is hard to tell which model performs better based only on the value of AUC. With the help of PR AUC, we come to the conclusion that the performance of example A is better than example B, which has a higher PR AUC value for all positive rates.

As shown in the ROC curves, the curves of example A are different from the ones of example B especially around the leftmost area. It indicates that the model of example A performs better in higher-rank samples - where more positive samples are classified correctly. The AUC value doesn’t identify the difference. However, we can clearly see the difference in the value and curve of the PR AUC between example A \& B.

To conclude, PR AUC provides the ability to differentiate the performance between balanced \& imbalanced data. It also helps to identify the performance around higher-rank area.



When to use PR AUC?

When two classes are equally important
AUC would be the metric to use if the goal of the model is to perform equally well on both classes. Image classification between cats \& dogs is a good example because the performance on cats is equally important on dogs.
When minority class is more important
PR AUC would be the metric to use if the focus of the model is to identify correctly as many positive samples as possible. Take spam detectors for example, the goal is to find all the possible spams. Regular emails are not of interest at all — they overshadow the number of positives.

There are no defined rules to select the suitable metrics. It really depends on the data and the application. It is important to think thoroughly about the purpose of the model before jumping into the modeling process.

One thing to note here is that the PR AUC serves as an alternative metric. If the model doesn’t work after the metric is changed, there are still other remedies to deal with imbalanced data, such as downsampling/upsampling. We’ll cover it later in future posts.

	abstract = {What does “balanced” mean for binary classification data? It simply means that the proportion of each class is equal. In binary classification, data is made up of two classes, positive and negative.

What’s imbalanced classification?

Take 1000 samples for example, one class is 500, and the other class is 500 in balanced data. 50\% of data are positive class, and vice versa. The distribution becomes skewed once it’s shifted toward one class, and is then called imbalanced data.

Imbalanced data is common in real life, such as fraud detection, cancer detection and customer conversion. However, it is not often mentioned in machine learning theory courses, based on my learning experiences. Here are some useful notes summarized from my personal learnings on real life data, that I feel worth sharing with everyone.

How far of a shifted distribution is considered imbalanced? There is no definite answer. Luckily there are some empirical rules to follow:
In Google’s online course, it considers 20 - 40\% minority class as mildly imbalanced, 1 - 20\% as moderately imbalanced, and {\textless}1\% as extremely imbalanced. (Usually, minority class indicates positive class.) In the video from h2o about the top 10 pitfalls in machine learning, it suggests to consider remedies for models when the minority class accounts for less than 10\% of the data.

Moreover, Google’s online course suggests to first train the model on the true distribution before jumping into any possible remedies. If the model works and generalizes, then you are good to go! If not, then other strategies should be considered to improve the model.
I cannot agree more when I first read about the these guidelines. Based on my personal experience, the model will only work sometimes when fitted on true distribution - 20\%{\textasciitilde}40\% minority class - without further treatment. It would be great to have a model fitted on true distribution though, as a benchmark for later.

It is important to consider remedies when it doesn’t work on true distribution, since most algorithms in machine learning learn weights from the data. Imbalanced volume of data would affect the learning process of algorithm - learning way more from the majority class. Here are some remedies for imbalanced classification, but it is not our focus today. We’ll cover it in future posts.

Precision-Recall Curve

In this post, we are going to talk about the Precision-Recall (PR) curve, which is similar to the ROC curve (Receiver Operation Characteristics) but with one of the axis changed from FPR to precision. Notably, the Precision-Recall curve can be used as an alternative metric to evaluate the classifier when the data is imbalanced.

In ROC, the curve is composed of the false positive rate (x-axis) \& the true positive rate/recall (y-axis), as shown in figure below. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is a widely-used metric to assess the overall model performance. The value of AUC ranges from 0 to 1, the larger the better. The ROC curve would move toward the upper right corner when the model performance improves. (Find in-depth discussion in previous post)





On the other hand, the PR curve is composed of the recall/true positive rate (x-axis) \& the precision (y-axis), as shown in figure below. The area under the PR ROC curve (PR AUC) provides a different perspective on evaluating the result of binary classifier. Lager PR AUC value indicates better model performance — the PR curve would move towards the upper left corner.

Not all the value between 0 to 1 is achievable for PR AUC. Varying by data, the baseline of PR curve is the horizontal line with y equals the value of the positive rate — P/(P+N) — the smallest value of precision. When the threshold goes to 0 (i.e. the rightmost point in the graph), all samples are classified as positive samples. That is, the number of true positive is equal to the number of positive samples. Thus, the value of the baseline decreases when the data become more imbalanced.

Details: Precision = TP/(TP + FP),  when threshold = 0, TP = P, FP = N, Precision = P/(P+N)





Note: The ROC \& PR ROC figures are plotted using the same dataset, which is binary classes with balanced classes

Why we need PR curve?

When data is imbalanced, the AUC might not reflect the true performance of the classifier. The definition of the False Positive Rate (FPR), is the number of false positives divided by the number of negative samples. FPR is considered better when it’s smaller since it indicates fewer false positives. In imbalanced data, the FPR tends to stay at small values due to the large numbers of negatives (i.e. making the denominator large). Thus, FPR becomes less informative for the model performance in this situation.

Below is a confusion matrix of an imbalanced dataset. As the figure shown, FPR shows a low value, indicating good model performance. However, precision - 0.09 - illustrates that the model is not able to distinguish between two classes well, and tend to predict more negative samples. Thus, PR AUC provides an alternative view for model performance by switching from FPR to precision.





Let’s have a deep dive into more examples. Here are the ROC curve \& PR curve of the output of binary classifier at various levels of separation and positive rates. In the following examples, 5 different levels of separation are chosen— Perfect, Excellent, Great, Good, Random —  and 3 different positive rates are selected — 0.5, 0.1 and 0.01 ranging from the balanced toward extremely imbalanced.  The data with the same level of separation but different positive rates is all sampled from the same distribution but at different sampling rate.

As the figure of ROC curve shown, the model performance across different positive rates are the same — the shape of ROC curve is nearly identical. On the other hand, the PR curves tell a different story — the model performance decreases when the positive rate decreases. When there are more negative samples, it is common to predict more outcome as negative samples, causing the precision to decrease. The baseline of different positive rates is also shown with the level of separation — Random. Notably, when comparing the ROC \& PR curves at the same positive rate, the overall relationship among various levels of separation is similar in both the ROC \& PR curve. Since the baseline shifted based on the positive rate, it is crucial to compare the PR AUC to baseline first rather than look straight into the absolute value of PR AUC. For example, the PR AUC of the Excellent status with 0.01 positive rate is 0.2. The absolute value of the PR AUC doesn’t look like a good outcome. However, it is 20 times better than the baseline 0.01!





Let’s look into another case. There are two example datasets with the same value of AUC (0.8) but different positive rates. As shown in ROC curve, the curves and values of AUC are all the same regardless of the positive rate. Thus, it is hard to tell which model performs better based only on the value of AUC. With the help of PR AUC, we come to the conclusion that the performance of example A is better than example B, which has a higher PR AUC value for all positive rates.

As shown in the ROC curves, the curves of example A are different from the ones of example B especially around the leftmost area. It indicates that the model of example A performs better in higher-rank samples - where more positive samples are classified correctly. The AUC value doesn’t identify the difference. However, we can clearly see the difference in the value and curve of the PR AUC between example A \& B.

	abstract = {Land use and land cover changes, such as deforestation, agricultural expansion and urbanization, are one of the largest anthropogenic environmental changes globally. Recent initiatives to evaluate the feasibility of malaria eradication have highlighted impacts of landscape changes on malaria transmission and the potential of these changes to undermine malaria control and elimination efforts. Multisectoral approaches are needed to detect and minimize negative impacts of land use and land cover changes on malaria transmission while supporting development aiding malaria control, elimination and ultimately eradication. Pathways through which land use and land cover changes disrupt social and ecological systems to increase or decrease malaria risks are outlined, identifying priorities and opportunities for a global malaria eradication campaign. The impacts of land use and land cover changes on malaria transmission are complex and highly context-specific, with effects changing over time and space. Landscape changes are only one element of a complex development process with wider economic and social dimensions affecting human health and wellbeing. While deforestation and other landscape changes threaten to undermine malaria control efforts and have driven the emergence of zoonotic malaria, most of the malaria elimination successes have been underpinned by agricultural development and land management. Malaria eradication is not feasible without addressing these changing risks while, conversely, consideration of malaria impacts in land management decisions has the potential to significantly accelerate progress towards eradication. Multisectoral cooperation and approaches to linking malaria control and environmental science, such as conducting locally relevant ecological monitoring, integrating landscape data into malaria surveillance systems and designing environmental management strategies to reduce malaria burdens, are essential to achieve malaria eradication.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Use of Insecticide Treated Nets for malaria control has been associated with shifts in mosquito vector feeding behavior including earlier and outdoor biting on humans. The relative contribution of phenotypic plasticity and heritability to these behavioural shifts is unknown. Elucidation of the mechanisms behind these shifts is crucial for anticipating impacts on vector control. We used a novel portable semi-field system (PSFS) to experimentally measure heritability of biting time in the malaria vector
            Anopheles arabiensis
            in Tanzania. In PSFS assays, the biting time of F2 offspring (early: 18:00-21:00, mid: 22:00-04:00 or late: 05:00-07:00) was significantly associated with that of their wild-caught F0 grandmothers, corresponding to an estimated heritability of 0.30 (95\% CI: 0.20, 0.41). F2 from early-biting F0 were more likely to bite early than F2 from mid or late late-biting F0. Similarly, the probability of biting late was higher in F2 derived from mid and late-biting F0 than from early-biting F0. Our results indicate that variation in biting time is attributable to additive genetic variation. Selection can therefore act efficiently on mosquito biting times, highlighting the need for control methods that target early and outdoor biting mosquitoes.},

	abstract = {In the era of “big data”, it is becoming more of a challenge to not only build state-of-the-art predictive models, but also gain an understanding of what’s really going on in the data. For example, it is often of interest to know which, if any, of the predictors in a ﬁtted model are relatively inﬂuential on the predicted outcome. Some modern algorithms—like random forests and gradient boosted decision trees—have a natural way of quantifying the importance or relative inﬂuence of each feature. Other algorithms—like naive Bayes classiﬁers and support vector machines—are not capable of doing so and model-free approaches are generally used to measure each predictor’s importance. In this paper, we propose a standardized, model-based approach to measuring predictor importance across the growing spectrum of supervised learning algorithms. Our proposed method is illustrated through both simulated and real data examples. The R code to reproduce all of the ﬁgures in this paper is available in the supplementary materials.},

With the use of World Health Organization diagnostic tests, 5 out of 6 samples were found cross-resistant to these insecticides. A strong decrease in knockdown effect and mortality was also observed when testing deltamethrin-impregnated nettings. With a polymerase chain reaction amplification of specfic alleles diagnostic test, resistance was found associated with the presence of a kdr mutation. The strong correlation between kdr allelic frequency and resistance to DDT or etofenprox indicated that kdr was the main resistance factor for these 2 insecticides. On the contrary, a lower correlation was observed between kdr frequency and resistance to 4 of the 5 pyrethroids tested, suggesting that another mechanism was also involved, likely a metabolic detoxification. These results point out the necessity to monitor pyrethroid resistance and the presence of kdr before implementation of any impregnated bed-net programs for malaria control. (Résumé d'auteur)},

          A lot of hype has recently been generated around deep learning, a group of artificial intelligence approaches able to break accuracy records in pattern recognition. Over the course of just a few years, deep learning revolutionized several research fields such as bioinformatics or medicine. Yet such a surge of tools and knowledge is still in its infancy in ecology despite the ever-growing size and the complexity of ecological datasets. Here we performed a literature review of deep learning implementations in ecology to identify its benefits in most ecological disciplines, even in applied ecology, up to decision makers and conservationists alike. We also provide guidelines on useful resources and recommendations for ecologists to start adding deep learning to their toolkit. At a time when automatic monitoring of populations and ecosystems generates a vast amount of data that cannot be processed by humans anymore, deep learning could become a necessity in ecology.},

Les phases du cycle gonotrophique sont les suivantes. - La phase 1 (entre la ponte et le repas de sang) dure une dizaine d'heures pour les femelles qui prennent leur repas de sang à proximité du gîte de ponte. Elle dure de 24 à 36 heures pour les femelles qui prennent leur repas de sang à quelques kilomètres du gîte de ponte. - La phase 2 (digestion et maturation ovarienne) dure de 48 à 52 heures. L'absence de dissociation gonotrophique suggère qu'il n'existe pas de phase prégravide pour les nullipares. - La phase 3 (entre la fin de la maturation et la ponte) dure une douzaine d'heures.

	abstract = {The antimalarial efficacy of the most important vector control interventions—long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS)—primarily protect against mosquitoes’ biting people when they are in bed and indoors. Mosquito bites taken outside of these times contribute to residual transmission which determines the maximum effectiveness of current malaria prevention. The likelihood mosquitoes feed outside the time of day when LLINs and IRS can protect people is poorly understood, and the proportion of bites received outdoors may be higher after prolonged vector control. A systematic review of mosquito and human behavior is used to quantify and estimate the public health impact of outdoor biting across Africa. On average 79\% of bites by the major malaria vectors occur during the time when people are in bed. This estimate is substantially lower than previous predictions, with results suggesting a nearly 10\% lower proportion of bites taken at the time when people are beneath LLINs since the year 2000. Across Africa, this higher outdoor transmission is predicted to result in an estimated 10.6 million additional malaria cases annually if universal LLIN and IRS coverage was achieved. Higher outdoor biting diminishes the cases of malaria averted by vector control. This reduction in LLIN effectiveness appears to be exacerbated in areas where mosquito populations are resistant to insecticides used in bed nets, but no association was found between physiological resistance and outdoor biting. Substantial spatial heterogeneity in mosquito biting behavior between communities could contribute to differences in effectiveness of malaria control across Africa.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Background
            Malaria control and prevention programs are more efficient and cost-effective when they target hotspots or select the best periods of year to implement interventions. This study aimed to identify the spatial distribution of malaria hotspots at the village level in Diébougou health district, Burkina Faso, and to model the temporal dynamics of malaria cases as a function of meteorological conditions and of the distance between villages and health centers (HCs).
          
          
            Methods
            Case data for 27 villages were collected in 13 HCs using continuous passive case detection. Meteorological data were obtained through remote sensing. Two synthetic meteorological indicators (SMIs) were created to summarize meteorological variables. Spatial hotspots were detected using the Kulldorf scanning method. A General Additive Model was used to determine the time lag between cases and SMIs and to evaluate the effect of SMIs and distance to HC on the temporal evolution of malaria cases. The multivariate model was fitted with data from the epidemic year to predict the number of cases in the following outbreak.
          
          
            Results
            Overall, the incidence rate in the area was 429.13 cases per 1,000 person-year with important spatial and temporal heterogeneities. Four spatial hotspots, involving 7 of the 27 villages, were detected, for an incidence rate of 854.02 cases per 1,000 person-year. The hotspot with the highest risk (relative risk = 4.06) consisted of a single village, with an incidence rate of 1,750.75 cases per 1,000 person-years. The multivariate analysis found greater variability in incidence between HCs than between villages linked to the same HC. The epidemic year was characterized by a major peak during the second part of the rainy season and a secondary peak during the dry-hot season. The time lag that generated the better predictions of cases was 9 weeks for SMI1 (positively correlated with precipitation variables and associated with the first peak of cases) and 16 weeks for SMI2 (positively correlated with temperature variables and associated with the secondary peak of cases). Euclidian distance to HC was not found to be a predictor of malaria cases recorded in HC. The prediction followed the overall pattern of the time series of reported cases and predicted the onset of the following outbreak with a precision of less than 3 weeks.
          
          
            Conclusions
            Our spatio-temporal analysis of malaria cases in Diébougou health district, Burkina Faso, provides a powerful prospective method for identifying and predicting high-risk areas and high-transmission periods that could be targeted in future malaria control and prevention campaigns.},

Up to now, mosquito abundance prediction problems were addressed with ad-hoc area-specific and genus-tailored approaches. We propose and develop MAMOTH, a generic and accurate Machine Learning model that predicts mosquito abundances for the upcoming period (the Mean Absolute Error of the predictions do not deviate more than 14\%). The designed model relies on satellite Earth Observation and other in-situ geo-spatial data to tackle the problem. MAMOTH is not site- nor mosquito genus-dependent; thus, it can be easily replicated and applied to multiple cases without any special parametrization. The model was applied to different mosquito genus and species Culex spp. as potential vectors for West Nile Virus, Anopheles spp. for Malaria and Aedes albopictus for Zika/Chikungunya/Dengue) and in different areas of interest (Italy, Serbia, France, Germany). The results show that the model performs accurately and consistently for all case studies. Additionally, the evaluation of different cases, with the model using the same principles, provides an opportunity for multi-case and multi-scope comparative studies.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Introduction. Longitudinal monitoring of outdoor-biting malaria vector populations is becoming increasingly important in understanding the dynamics of residual malaria transmission. However, the human landing catch (HLC), the gold standard for measuring human biting rates indoors and outdoors, is costly and raises ethical concerns related to increased risk of infective bites among collectors.  Consequently, routine data on outdoor-feeding mosquito populations are usually limited due to the lack of a scalable tool with similar sensitivity to outdoor HLC. Methodology. The
            Anopheles
            trapping sensitivity of four baited proxy outdoor trapping methods—Furvela tent trap (FTT), host decoy trap (HDT), mosquito electrocuting traps (MET) and outdoor CDC light traps (OLT)—was assessed relative to HLC in a 5x5 replicated Latin square conducted over 25 nights in two villages of western Kenya. Indoor CDC light trap (ILT) was run in one house in each of the compounds with outdoor traps, while additional non-Latin square indoor and outdoor HLC collections were performed in one of the study villages. Results. The MET, FTT, HDT and OLT sampled approximately 4.67, 7.58, 5.69 and 1.98 times more
            An. arabiensis
            compared to HLC, respectively, in Kakola Ombaka. Only FTT was more sensitive relative to HLC in sampling of
            An. funestus
            in Kakola Ombaka (RR=5.59, 95\%CI: 2.49-12.55, P {\textless} 0.001) and Masogo (RR=4.38, 95\%CI: 1.62-11.80, P = 0.004) and in sampling
            An. arabiensis
            in Masogo (RR=5.37, 95\%CI: 2.17-13.24, P {\textless} 0.001). OLT sampled significantly higher numbers of
            An. coustani
            in Kakola Ombaka (RR=3.03, 95\%CI: 1.65-5.56, P {\textless} 0.001) and Masogo (RR=2.88, 95\%CI: 1.15-7.22, P=0.02) compared to HLC.  OLT, HLC and MET sampled mostly
            An. coustani
            , FTT had similar proportions of
            An. funestus
            and
            An. arabiensis
            , while HDT sampled predominantly
            An. arabiensis
            in both villages. FTT showed close correlation with ILT in vector abundance for all three species at both collection sites. Conclusion. FTT and OLT are simple, easily scalable traps and are potential replacements for HLC in outdoor sampling of
            Anopheles
            mosquitoes. However, the FTT closely mirrored indoor CDC light trap in mosquito indices and therefore may be more of an indoor mimic than a true outdoor collection tool. HDT and MET show potential for sampling outdoor host seeking mosquitoes. However, the traps as currently designed may not be feasible for large scale, longitudinal entomological monitoring. Therefore, the baited outdoor CDC light trap may be the most appropriate tool currently available for assessment of outdoor-biting and malaria transmission risk.},

              The decline in malaria across Africa has been largely attributed to vector control using long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs). However, this intervention has prompted widespread insecticide resistance (IR) and been associated with changes in mosquito behaviour that reduce their contact with LLINs. The relative importance and rate at which IR and behavioural adaptations emerge are poorly understood. We conducted surveillance of mosquito behaviour and IR at 12 sites in Burkina Faso to assess the magnitude and temporal dynamics of insecticide, biting and resting behaviours in vectors in the 2-year period following mass LLIN distribution. Insecticide resistance was present in all vector populations and increased rapidly over the study period. In contrast, no longitudinal shifts in LLIN-avoidance behaviours (earlier or outdoor biting and resting) were detected. There was a moderate but statistically significant shift in vector species composition from
              Anopheles coluzzii
              to
              Anopheles gambiae
              which coincided with a reduction in the proportion of bites preventable by LLINs; possibly driven by between-species variation in behaviour. These findings indicate that adaptations based on insecticide resistance arise and intensify more rapidly than behavioural shifts within mosquito vectors. However, longitudinal shifts in mosquito vector species composition were evident within 2 years following a mass LLIN distribution. This ecological shift was characterized by a significant increase in the exophagic species (
              An. gambiae
              ) and coincided with a predicted decline in the degree of protection expected from LLINs. Although human exposure fell through the study period due to reducing vector densities and infection rates, such ecological shifts in vector species along with insecticide resistance were likely to have eroded the efficacy of LLINs. While both adaptations impact malaria control, the rapid increase of the former indicates this strategy develops more quickly in response to selection from LLINS. However, interventions targeting both resistance strategies will be needed.},

              Background
              
                In rural Burkina Faso, the primary malaria vector
                Anopheles gambiae
                sensu lato (
                s.l
                .) primarily feeds indoors at night. Identification of factors which influence mosquito house entry could lead to development of novel malaria vector control interventions. A study was therefore carried out to identify risk factors associated with house entry of
                An. gambiae s.l
                . in south-west Burkina Faso, an area of high insecticide resistance.
              
            
            
              Methods
              
                Mosquitoes were sampled monthly during the malaria transmission season using CDC light traps in 252 houses from 10 villages, each house sleeping at least one child aged five to 15 years old. Potential risk factors for house entry of
                An. gambiae s.l.
                were measured, including socio-economic status, caregiver’s education and occupation, number of people sleeping in the same part of the house as the child, use of anti-mosquito measures, house construction and fittings, proximity of anopheline aquatic habitats and presence of animals near the house. Mosquito counts were compared using a generalized linear mixed-effect model with negative binomial and log link function, adjusting for repeated collections.
              
            
            
              Results
              
                20,929 mosquitoes were caught, of which 16,270 (77.7\%) were
                An. gambiae s.l.
                Of the 6691
                An. gambiae s.l
                . identified to species, 4101 (61.3\%) were
                An. gambiae
                sensu stricto and 2590 (38.7\%)
                Anopheles coluzzii
                . Having a metal-roof on the child’s sleeping space (IRR = 0.55, 95\% CI 0.32–0.95, p = 0.03) was associated with fewer malaria vectors inside the home.
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              
                This study demonstrated that the rate of
                An. gambiae s.l.
                was 45\% lower in sleeping spaces with a metal roof, compared to those with thatch roofs. Improvements in house construction, including installation of metal roofs, should be considered in endemic areas of Africa to reduce the burden of malaria.},

              Malaria is among the oldest of diseases. In one form or another, it has infected and affected our ancestors since long before the origin of the human line. During our recent evolution, its influence has probably been greater than that of any other infectious agent. Here we attempt to trace the forms and impacts of malaria from a distant past through historical times to the present. In the last sections, we review the current burdens of malaria across the world and discuss present-day approaches to its management. Only by following, or attempting to follow, malaria throughout its evolution and history can we understand its character and so be better prepared for our future management of this ancient ill.},

	url = {http://geoconfluences.ens-lyon.fr/glossaire/risque-s},
	abstract = {En géographie, un risque est la possibilité qu'un aléa se produise et touche une population vulnérable à cet aléa. L'équivalent anglais est risk.
 Il ne faut donc pas confondre aléa, risque et vulnérabilité. L'aléa est un phénomène (naturel ou technologique) plus ou moins probable sur un espace donné. La vulnérabilité exprime le niveau d'effet prévisible de ce phénomène sur des enjeux (l'homme et ses activités). Le risque peut être défini comme la probabilité d’occurrence de dommage compte tenu des interactions entre facteurs d’endommagement (aléas) et facteurs de vulnérabilité (peuplement, répartition des biens). On peut ainsi résumer cette définition par une formule : « risque = aléa × vulnérabilité ». La notion de risque recouvre à la fois le danger potentiel de catastrophe et la perception qu'en a la société, l’endommagement potentiel, comme celle de l’endommagement effectif. Un risque peut être d'origine naturelle ou peut avoir des causes purement anthropiques (risques technologiques, risques géopolitiques par exemple).
 Les risques « naturels » se rapportent à des aléas qui font intervenir des processus naturels variés : atmosphériques, hydrologiques, géologiques ou géomorphologiques. Les guillements sont importants car tout risque implique la présence d'une société humaine vulnérable, le risque a dont nécessairement une composante anthropique. Le risque naturel se situe donc à la croisée entre, d'une part, un ou plusieurs aléas, et, d'autre part, la vulnérabilité d'une société et/ou d'un territoire qu'elle occupe. L'aléa ne devient un risque qu'en présence d'enjeux humains, économiques et environnementaux. Par exemple, un typhon sur un atoll désert de l'océan Pacifique n'est pas un risque, mais un cyclone sur les îles densément habitées des Caraïbes devient un risque majeur et provoque des dommages considérables. La question des risques naturels permet ainsi de revisiter un vieux paradigme de la géographie, celui des rapports entre les sociétés et la nature.
 Le risque, d'origine naturelle ou technologique, est dit majeur lorsqu'il peut faire de très nombreuses victimes et occasionner des dommages considérables, dépassant les capacités de réaction des instances concernées (États, sociétés civiles), à l'échelle de la zone touchée. Le risque majeur est caractérisé conjointement par une faible probabilité d’occurrence (faible fréquence) et d'énormes impacts, il peut alors devenir une catastrophe perturbant durablement les équilibres naturels et sociaux à divers niveaux d'échelle. Les conséquences, pour la population, sont dans tous les cas tragiques en raison du déséquilibre brutal entre besoins et moyens de secours disponibles.
 Le risque s'entend également au sens de la prise de risque. Il est au cœur du principe de précaution et de la gestion de l'incertitude. On peut distinguer le risque – situation pour laquelle une liste de toutes les éventualités et de leur probabilité de réalisation peut être établie – de l'incertitude, situation pour laquelle l'une ou l'autre de ces deux conditions n'est pas vérifiée.
 L'incertitude exprime le degré avec lequel une valeur (l’état futur du système climatique, par exemple) est inconnue. L’incertitude peut être due à un manque d’informations ou à un désaccord sur ce qui est connu, voire sur ce qui peut être connu. Elle peut avoir des origines diverses : erreurs quantifiables au niveau des données ; concepts ou terminologie aux définitions ambiguës ; prévisions/projections du comportement humain difficiles à anticiper. L’incertitude peut donc être représentée par des mesures quantitatives (une fourchette de valeurs calculées par divers modèles, par exemple) ou par des énoncés qualitatifs (reflétant l’opinion d’un groupe d’experts).
 L'atténuation ou la mitigation des risques repose sur les trois « P » : prévision, prévention, protection. La prévision du risque permet de mettre en place des protocoles, et d'informer la population de manière claire : selon la nature de l'aléa, il peut être conseillé de fuir (tsunami) ou au contraire de rester chez soi en adoptant les bonnes pratiques (séisme). La prévision peut se faire plusieurs heures avant ou seulement quelques minutes, selon l'aléa, et elle peut aussi être latente : on sait que dans le lit majeur d'une rivière, des inondations se produiront inévitablement, sans pouvoir en prédire la date. La prévention et la protection regroupent toutes les actions mises en oeuvre pour minimiser les effets du risque, soit en informant sans relâche les populations et les acteurs (sécurité civile, pompiers, personnels de santé, enseignants...) soit en contruisant des ouvrages d'art, en adoptant des zonages, en adaptant le bâti. Un ouvrage de protection peut cependant aggraver le risque si la force de l'aléa dépasse la prévision (digues, enrochements, etc.) La résilience désigne la capacité d'une société à retrouver un équilibre après la réalisation du risque.  
 Le niveau des risques « naturels » pourrait se voir amplifié par les impacts des évolutions climatiques, aggravées par la croissance démographique mondiale et par la pression sur les ressources. Des communautés entières sont d’ores et déjà chassées, provisoirement ou définitivement, de leur habitat par différentes crises environnementales parfois meurtrières : sécheresses, inondations, séismes, etc. Or, dans le droit juridique international, aucune protection ne s’applique aux victimes de catastrophes naturelles qui ne peuvent prétendre au statut de réfugié et qui, le plus souvent, sont déplacées à l’intérieur de leur propre pays.

	abstract = {A better understanding of malaria transmission at a local scale is essential for developing and implementing effective control strategies. In the framework of a randomized controlled trial (RCT), we aimed to provide an updated description of malaria transmission in the Korhogo area, northern Côte d’Ivoire, and to obtain baseline data for the trial. We performed human landing collections (HLCs) in 26 villages in the Korhogo area during the rainy season (September–October 2016, April–May 2017) and the dry season (November–December 2016, February–March 2017). We used PCR techniques to ascertain the species of the
              Anopheles gambiae
              complex,
              Plasmodium falciparum
              sporozoite infection, and insecticide resistance mechanisms in a subset of
              Anopheles
              vectors.
              Anopheles gambiae s.l.
              was the predominant malaria vector in the Korhogo area. Overall, more vectors were collected outdoors than indoors (
              p
               {\textless} 0.001). Of the 774
              An. gambiae s.l.
              tested in the laboratory, 89.65\% were
              An. gambiae s.s.
              and 10.35\% were
              An. coluzzii
              . The frequencies of the
              kdr
              allele were very high in
              An. gambiae s.s.
              but the
              ace-1
              allele was found at moderate frequencies. An unprotected individual living in the Korhogo area received an average of 9.04, 0.63, 0.06 and 0.12 infected bites per night in September–October, November–December, February–March, and April–May, respectively. These results demonstrate that the intensity of malaria transmission is extremely high in the Korhogo area, especially during the rainy season. Malaria control in highly endemic areas such as Korhogo needs to be strengthened with complementary tools in order to reduce the burden of the disease.
            
          , 
            
              Une meilleure connaissance de la transmission du paludisme à l’échelle locale est essentielle pour élaborer et mettre en œuvre des stratégies de lutte efficaces. Dans le cadre d’un essai contrôlé randomisé, nous avons pour objectifs de fournir une description actualisée de la transmission du paludisme dans la zone de Korhogo, au nord de la Côte d’Ivoire, et de collecter les données de base pour l’essai. Nous avons capturé les moustiques sur des volontaires humains dans 26 villages de la zone de Korhogo pendant la saison pluvieuse (septembre–octobre 2016, avril–mai 2017) et la saison sèche (novembre–décembre 2016, février–mars 2017). À l’aide des techniques de PCR, nous avons déterminé les espèces au sein du complexe
              Anopheles gambiae
              , les infections par
              Plasmodium falciparum
              au stade sporozoïte et les mécanismes de résistance aux insecticides dans un sous-échantillon d’anophèles vecteurs.
              Anopheles gambiae s.l.
              est de loin le vecteur majoritaire du paludisme dans la zone de Korhogo. Au total, plus de vecteurs ont été collectés à l’extérieur des habitations qu’à l’intérieur (
              p
               {\textless} 0.001). Des 774
              An. gambiae s.l.
              analysés au laboratoire, 89,65 \% étaient
              An. gambiae s.s.
              et 10,35 \%
              An. coluzzii
              . Les fréquences alléliques du gène
              kdr
              étaient très élevées chez
              An. gambiae s.s.
              alors que les fréquences alléliques du gène
              ace-1
              étaient modérées. Une personne non protégée vivant à Korhogo reçoit chaque nuit en moyenne 9,04 piqûres infectantes (pi) en septembre–octobre, 0,63 pi en novembre–décembre, 0,06 pi en février-mars et 0,12 pi en avril–mai. Ces résultats démontrent que l’intensité de la transmission du paludisme est très élevée dans la zone de Korhogo, particulièrement en saison pluvieuse. La lutte contre le paludisme dans les zones de forte endémicité comme Korhogo doit être renforcée par des outils complémentaires afin de réduire le fardeau de la maladie.},

abstract="Female mosquitoes are sampled primarily through the use of a suitable bait to attract hungry host-seeking individuals. Human bait catches or landing catches have been used for many years and remain the most useful single method to collect anthropophagic species. Variations on the simple direct bait catch have included enclosing humans or other bait animals in nets, cages or traps which, in theory at least, permit the entrance of mosquitoes but prevent their escape. Although bait catches are not completely free from sampling bias they are usually more so than most other collecting methods that employ an attractant. Direct human landing catches are easily performed and require no complicated or expensive equipment. In some areas, especially in North America, light-traps, with or without carbon dioxide as a supplement, have more or less replaced human and animal baits as a routine sampling method for several species, and the use of light-traps in conjunction with a human volunteer sleeping inside a mosquito net as an alternative to the human landing catch has been investigated in several countries and is discussed further in Chapter 9. However, despite intensive studies on host-seeking behaviour no trapping method has been identified that is sufficiently effective to completely replace the use of human landing catches or animal-baited traps.",

Collections were separated into three 4-hourly  samples each night. A total of 17 591 mosquitoes belonging to nine species were  collected, 6747 in light traps and 10 844 in tent traps. Anopheles funestus (n =  7634) and Mansonia africana (n = 4859) were the most abundant species. Fluctuations  in temperature and humidity were the two environmental variables associated with  changes in relative abundance of mosquitoes. Most An. funestus were collected  indoors, with the majority collected in the first 4 h of the night. This was most  evident on nights when moonlight was present in the early part of the night. A total  of 3488 An. funestus were dissected for gonotrophic age determination. Parous rates  did not change with lunar phase, but estimated oviposition cycle length was  significantly shorter on nights when moonlight was present at the time of  oviposition. Moonlight at dusk did not, however, affect the proportion of newly  emerged insects with mating plugs collected. Outdoor transmission of malaria,  especially on moonlit nights, remains a problem for control programmes.},

Since its first release in 2004, SAGA has rapidly developed from a specialized tool for digital terrain analysis to a comprehensive and globally established GIS platform for scientific analysis and modeling. SAGA is coded in C++ in an object oriented design and runs under several operating systems including Windows and Linux. Key functional features of the modular software architecture comprise an application programming interface for the development and implementation of new geoscientific methods, a user friendly graphical user interface with many visualization options, a command line interpreter, and interfaces to interpreted languages like R and Python. The current version 2.1.4 offers more than 600 tools, which are implemented in dynamically loadable libraries or shared objects and represent the broad scopes of SAGA in numerous fields of geoscientific endeavor and beyond. In this paper, we inform about the system's architecture, functionality, and its current state of development and implementation. Furthermore, we highlight the wide spectrum of scientific applications of SAGA in a review of published studies, with special emphasis on the core application areas digital terrain analysis, geomorphology, soil science, climatology and meteorology, as well as remote sensing.},

This community effect on nearby  compounds without nets is approximately as strong as the effect observed within  villages with ITNs. This implies that in areas with intense malaria transmission  with high ITN coverage, the primary effect of insecticide-treated nets is via  area-wide effects on the mosquito population and not, as commonly supposed, by  simple imposition of a physical barrier protecting individuals from biting.

            Insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) are one of the most widespread and impactful malaria interventions in Africa, yet a spatially-resolved time series of ITN coverage has never been published. Using data from multiple sources, we generate high-resolution maps of ITN access, use, and nets-per-capita annually from 2000 to 2020 across the 40 highest-burden African countries. Our findings support several existing hypotheses: that use is high among those with access, that nets are discarded more quickly than official policy presumes, and that effectively distributing nets grows more difficult as coverage increases. The primary driving factors behind these findings are most likely strong cultural and social messaging around the importance of net use, low physical net durability, and a mixture of inherent commodity distribution challenges and less-than-optimal net allocation policies, respectively. These results can inform both policy decisions and downstream malaria analyses.},

              Background
              
                Identification and better understanding of potential risk factors for malaria are important for targeted and cost-effective health interventions. Housing conditions have been suggested as one of the potential risk factors. This study aims to further investigate this risk factor, and is focused on the effect of the type of roof on
                Plasmodium falciparum
                infection among children below five years in the North West of Burkina Faso.
              
            
            
              Methods
              
                In a cross-sectional study design, 661 children aged six to 60 months were randomly selected from three rural and one semi-urban site at the end of the rainy season (November 2003). The children were screened for fever and tested for
                Plasmodium falciparum
                infection. In addition, data on bed net use and house characteristics was collected from the household were each child lived. Using adjusted odds ratios, children living in house roofed with iron-sheet were compared with those in house with mud or grass roof.
              
            
            
              Results
              
                Overall
                P. falciparum
                infection prevalence was 22.8 \% with a significant variation between (Chi-square, p {\textless} 0.0001). The prevalence in Cissé (33.3 \%) and Goni (30.6 \%) were twice times more than in Nouna (15.2 \%) and Kodougou (13.2 \%). After adjusting for age, sex, use of bed net and housing conditions, children living in houses with mud roofs had significantly higher risk of getting
                P. falciparum
                infection compared to those living in iron-sheet roofed houses (Odds Ratio 2.6; 95\% Confidence Interval, 1.4–4.7).
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              
                These results suggest that house characteristics should be taken into consideration when designing health intervention against
                P. falciparum
                infection and particular attention should be paid to children living in houses with mud roofs.},

              Background
              Simple modifications of typical rural house design can be an effective and relatively inexpensive method of reducing indoor mosquito vector densities and consequently decreasing malaria transmission. Public health scientists have shown the potential for house design to protect people against malaria, yet this type of intervention remains virtually ignored. A randomized-controlled study was, therefore, undertaken to determine the effects of this method of vector control on the density of indoor resting malaria vectors in a rice irrigation scheme area in lowlands of western Kenya.
            
            
              Methods
              Ten treatment houses were modified with ceilings of papyrus mats and insecticide-treated netting (ITN) and tested against ten control houses without papyrus ceilings. To determine densities of mosquitoes resting in homes, the pyrethrum spray method was used to simultaneously collect indoor resting malaria vectors in intervention and control houses. Each house was sampled a total of eight times over a period of four months, resulting in a total of 80 sampling efforts for each treatment. Community response to such intervention was investigated by discussions with residents.
            
            
              Results
              
                Papyrus mats ceiling modification reduced house entry by
                Anopheles gambiae s.l
                and
                Anopheles funestus

              Conclusion
              House modifications involving insect screen ceilings made from locally available materials and small ITN incorporated in house construction have the potential to reduce human exposure to malaria vectors, and thus parasite infection, in a rice irrigation scheme area of western Kenya. Ceiling modification is likely to be acceptable and is expected to be of greatest benefit when used in combination with other malaria control strategies.},

            Since the implementation of Roll Back Malaria, the widespread use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) is thought to have played a major part in the decrease in mortality and morbidity achieved in malaria-endemic regions. In the past decade, resistance to major classes of insecticides recommended for public health has spread across many malaria vector populations. Increasingly, malaria vectors are also showing changes in vector behaviour in response to current indoor chemical vector control interventions. Changes in the time of biting and proportion of indoor biting of major vectors, as well as changes in the species composition of mosquito communities threaten the progress made to control malaria transmission. Outdoor biting mosquito populations contribute to malaria transmission in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa and pose new challenges as they cannot be reliably monitored or controlled using conventional tools. Here, we review existing and novel approaches that may be used to target outdoor communities of malaria vectors. We conclude that scalable tools designed specifically for the control and monitoring of outdoor biting and resting malaria vectors with increasingly complex and dynamic responses to intensifying malaria control interventions are urgently needed. These are crucial for integrated vector management programmes designed to challenge current and future vector populations.},

            An increasing number of model-agnostic interpretation techniques for machine learning (ML) models such as partial dependence plots (PDP), permutation feature importance (PFI) and Shapley values provide insightful model interpretations, but can lead to wrong conclusions if applied incorrectly. We highlight many general pitfalls of ML model interpretation, such as using interpretation techniques in the wrong context, interpreting models that do not generalize well, ignoring feature dependencies, interactions, uncertainty estimates and issues in high-dimensional settings, or making unjustified causal interpretations, and illustrate them with examples. We focus on pitfalls for global methods that describe the average model behavior, but many pitfalls also apply to local methods that explain individual predictions. Our paper addresses ML practitioners by raising awareness of pitfalls and identifying solutions for correct model interpretation, but also addresses ML researchers by discussing open issues for further research.},
